introduced much-awaited cybercab a sleek two-seater but key technical details -- such as sensor configurations processing capabilities -- were notably absent musks decision to forgo lidar technology a feature commonly used by competitors like waymo could potentially raise regulatory concerns about safety compliance1optimus (humanoid robot) while optimus robots were a hit at event performing tasks like serving drinks dancing this entertaining display overshadowed reality of how far technology from practical use reports indicated that robots were primarily operated by humans raising questions about their actual autonomous capabilities readiness for industrial applications2robovan a surprise announcement was debut of robovan a versatile vehicle intended for both mass transit cargo transport its stylish art deco-inspired design drew attention but like cybercab it lacked concrete details or technical insights to convince analysts that product close to entering production presentation didnt provide enough information to quell investor skepticism about its feasibility3 full self-driving (fsd) progress elon musk projected that teslas fsd technology would achieve full autonomy by 2026 with cybercab current models (like model 3 model y) spearheading this effort texas california however musks history of ambitious fsd promises has been met with ongoing skepticism this presentation did little to change that no new safety data or significant updates were provided to address reliability concerns leaving regulatory safety issues unresolved tesla still faces significant challenges proving its fsd capabilities are ready for public use without human oversight obtaining regulatory approval at both federal state levels4market reaction analysts expressed mixed feelings about event while some found futuristic concepts inspiring others noted lack of substantial progress vague nature of musks promises this left investors questioning how close tesla truly to achieving its autonomy robotics goals for many event leaned more towards spectacle than solid evidence of progressshareholder deck updates1supercharger network teslas supercharger network received widespread industry support with most automakers now adopting teslas north american charging standard (nacs) this acceptance likely to boost teslas services segment improve its margins long term number of supercharger stations increased by 20% year-over-year to 6706 tesla also rehired some of nearly 500 supercharger team members who had been laid off earlier year indicating renewed focus on this segment2market

readiness geographic order locationskey quotes from earnings callelon on cybercab- i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 were aiming for at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimatelymusk envisions cybercab becoming a global high-volume autonomous vehicle service however achieving this scale requires overcoming two major challenges delivering level 5 autonomy at a competitive cost navigating regulatory approval across regions with varying laws road conditions weather considerations- musk also dismissed notion of a regular low-cost model stating i think having a regular $ 25000 model* pointless he emphasized focusing on cybercab as a generational leap forwardmusk on fsd- our internal estimate **q2 of next year** to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereafterhe expressed confidence that full autonomy could be achieved 2025 with existing vehicle models although regulatory hurdles safety standards remain significant barrierson teslas ridesharing app- tesla already testing a *ridesharing capability* bay area for employees with safety drivers currently place musk anticipates launching service for public california texas next

however product remains at an early development stage will likely take years to fully commercializeon teslas valuation- musk reiterated his bold prediction tesla will become most valuable company

uber rideshare futurethere are two distinct paths to achieving full autonomy1waymos approach waymo focuses on highly structured geo-fenced environments with extensive pre-mapping sensor-based systems like lidar to ensure safety2teslas approach tesla aims to develop a generalized self-driving system that works with computer vision ai relying on its fleets extensive data advantage scaling software improvements however teslas reluctance to use lidar technology regulatory challenges could hinder its timeline for achieving level 5 autonomythese differing strategies highlight varied paths to delivering a future of autonomous transportation with each approach facing unique technical regulatory hurdleslevels of autonomy- teslas fsd (supervised) teslas full self-driving system remains at **level 2** meaning it still requires driver supervision to operate contrast **waymo** operates at **level 4** certain cities where its vehicles can drive without human intervention albeit under specific conditions-jumping levels musks vision for cybercab aims to skip from level 2 to **level 5 autonomy** which implies no need for human input at all -- a huge leaptechnology approach-teslas strategy tesla relies on a **camera ai-only approach** focusing on software data scalability rather than expensive hardware musks bet that advanced software can eventually solve all driving scenarios- waymos strategy waymo uses a **hardware-intensive model** with a combination of lidar radar cameras** providing highly precise navigation however reliance on multiple sensors leads to higher production costs per vehicle around **$200000** eachscaling challenges-waymos limitation high cost of waymos vehicles has hindered its ability to scale quickly while tesla plans to leverage its extensive fleet data to improve its autonomous systems over time-teslas repeated delays despite its aspirations teslas full autonomy timeline has faced numerous delays scaling quickly while achieving robust safe autonomy remains a significant challenge for companysafety regulation-waymos approach waymo has built trust with regulators by deploying vehicles cautiously select cities prioritizing safety but its operations remain limited geographically-teslas regulatory hurdles cybercabs design lacks traditional controls like steering wheels pedals raising concerns about regulatory approval these changes could face substantial scrutiny particularly if safety standards require features teslas design omitstesla uber competitors or partners-potential partnership uber ceo dara khosrowshahi found cybercab vision pretty compelling didnt dismiss possibility of a collaboration uber already partners with waymo to offer autonomous rides cities like **phoenix atlanta austin** khosrowshahis openness to partnership means theres potential for teslas cybercab fleet owners to list their vehicles on uber to boost earnings-hybrid model by leveraging ubers vast network tesla could quickly gain scale local markets especially given ubers capability to serve diverse customer needs this could lead to a hybrid model where teslas autonomous vehicles are available on uber alongside other optionsregulatory challenges an obstacle to elons vision -waymos critique former waymo ceo john krafcik criticized cybercab highlighting its impracticality for a large-scale robotaxi business waymos approach focuses on accessibility safety with taller vehicles high-mounted sensors whereas teslas design was light on crucial technical details-possible lidar mandate krafcik also noted that if regulators eventually require lidar technology for safety compliance teslas camera-only approach could face a significant setback regulatory decisions are beyond teslas control could fundamentally reshape its autonomy strategy-musks political maneuvering musks political activities controversies could complicate teslas regulatory relations building strong connections with regulators critical given their power to greenlight or halt cybercabs deploymentfinal thoughtsthe coming years will be pivotal for tesla as it strives to overcome both techno logical regulatory challenges success of teslas autonomy plans hinges not just on its technological progress but also on its ability to navigate complex varied regulatory frameworks worldwide whether musks bold vision for full autonomy

joined today by elon musk vaibhav taneja a number of other executives our q3 results were announced at about 3 pm central time update deck we published at same link as this webcast during this call we will discuss our business outlook make forward-looking statements these comments are based on our predictions expectations as of today actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks uncertainties including those mentioned our most recent filings with sec during question-and-answer portion of todays call please limit yourself to one question one follow-up please use raise hand button to join question queue before we jump into q&a elon has some opening remarks elonelon musk thank you so to recap something that [indiscernible] industry ive seen year-over-year declines order volumes q3 tesla at same time has achieved record deliveries fact i think if you look at ev companies worldwide to best of my knowledge no ev company even profitable im not - to best of my knowledge there was no ev division of any company of any existing auto company that profitable so it notable that tesla profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment this quarter actually a record q3 for us so we produced our 7-millionth vehicle actually just yesterday so congratulations to teams that made it happen tesla thats staggeringly immense amount of work to make 7million cars so lets see we also have energy storage business growing like wildfire with strong demand for both megapack powerwall as people know on october 10th we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that i think very compelling so tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an opportunity to experience future where you have humanoid robots walking among crowd not with a canned video presentation or anything but literally walking among crowd serving drinks whatnot we had 50 autonomous vehicles there were 20 cybercabs but there were an additional 30 model ys operating fully autonomously entire night carrying thousands of peoples [indiscernible] with no incidents entire night so -- for those who went there that -- its worth emphasizing that these cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator pedals meaning there was no -- theres no -- there was no way for anyone to intervene manually even if they wanted to whole night went very smoothly so regarding vehicle business we are still on-track to deliver more affordable models starting first half of 2025 this i think probably people are wondering what should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year at risk of - to take a bit of risk here i do want to give some rough estimate which i think its 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year notwithstanding negative external events like if theres some force majeure events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that then we cant overcome massive force majeure events but i think with our lower cost vehicles with advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year my best guess then cybercab reaching volume production 26 i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 so just starting production reaching volume production 26 thats -- that should be substantial were aiming for at least 2 million units a year of cybercab thatll be more than one factory but i think its at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimately so yeah these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses that those are my best guesses cell 4680 lines team actually doing great work there 4680 rapidly approaching point where it most competitive set so when you consider fully landed - cost of a battery pack fully landed us net of incentives duties 4680 tracking to be most competitive meaning lower cost [indiscernible] considered than any other alternative were not quite there yet but were close to being there which i think extremely exciting weve got several - a lot of ideas to go well beyond that so if i think theres -- if we execute well 4680 will have -- tesla internally produced cell will be most cost competitive cell north america a testament to a tremendous amount of hard work there by team so thats - well continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors our intent not to make to provide to make cells just internally so i dont want to set off any alarm bells here were also increasing substantially our vehicle output our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cells most of them will still come from suppliers but i think it some good news that tesla internal cell likely - tracking to be most competitive us so with respect to autonomy as people are experiencing cars really from week-to-week there are significant improvements miles between interventions so with new version 125 release of full self-driving cybertruck combining code into a single stack so that city driving entering highway driving are one stack which a bigger burden for highway driving so its just all neural nets release of actually smart summon were trying to have a sense of humor here were also -- so that thats 125 version 13 of fsd going out soon ashok will elaborate more on that later call we expect to see some roughly a 5 or 6 fold improvement miles between interventions compared to 125 looking at year as a whole improvement miles between interventions we think will be at least three orders of magnitude so thats a very dramatic improvement course of year we expect that trend to continue next year so current internal expectation for tesla fsd having longer miles between intervention than human second quarter of next year which means it may end up being third quarter but its next - it seems extremely likely to be next year ashok do you want to add anythingashok elluswamy yeah miles between critical interventions yep like you mentioned elon we already made a 100x improvement with 125 from starting of this year then with v13 release we expect to be a 1000x from beginning - from january of this year on production [indiscernible] software this came because technology improvements going to end-to-end having higher frame rate partly also helped by hardware force more capabilities so on we hope that we continue to scale neural network data training compute et cetera by q2 next year we should cross over average human miles per critical intervention call it collision that caseelon musk so thats not sandbagging or anything else our internal estimate q2 of next year to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter so a vast majority of humanity has no idea that teslas drive themselves so especially for something like a model 3 or model y it looks like a normal car so you dont expect normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself cybercab looks different cybertruck looks different but model y model 3 look theyre good looking cars but look i think look fairly normal you dont expect a fairly normal looking car to have intelligence enough ai to be able to drive itself but it does so we do want to expose that to more people so were doing every time we have a significant improvement software well roll out another sort of 30 day trial so to encourage people to try it again we are seeing a significant improvement adoption so take rate for fsd has improved substantially especially after 10/10 event so theres no need to wait for a robo-taxi or cybercab to experience full autonomy we expect to achieve that next year with -- with our existing vehicle lineashok elluswamy one point actually smart summon gives a small taste of what its going to look like car able to drive itself to user within private parking lots currently its speed limited but then its going to quickly be increased we already had more than 1 million usage [indiscernible] of smart summonelon musk yep so we actually we have for tesla employees bay area we already are offering a ride-hailing capability so you can actually with development app you can request a ride itll take you anywhere bay area we do have a safety driver for now but software required to do that weve developed i mean david do you want to elaborate on thatunidentified company representative  yeah sure david we showed some screenshots of this q1 shareholder deck yeah this real weve been testing it for better part of year building blocks that we needed order to build this functionality deliver it to production weve been thinking about working on for years it just so happens that weve used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers meantime such as sharing your profile synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into whether its another car that you own or a car that somebodys loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into it looks exactly like yours everythings synchronized seat mirror positions media navigation everything same just what you would expect from one of our robotaxis but we gave that functionality to our customers right now because we built it intending for it to be used future were releasing that functionality now all -- then cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality sending a navigation to destination from your phone to vehicle so were doing that now with ride-hailing app but its something that weve made available to customers for years seeing progress on route mobile app thats something youll need for ride-hailing app but again we released it meantime so its not like were just starting to think about this stuff right now while were building out early stages of our ride-hailing network weve been thinking about this for quite a long time were excited to get functionality out thereelon musk yeah we do expect to roll out ride-hailing california texas next year to public but not california somewhat theres quite a long regulatory approval process i think we should get approval next year but its contingent upon regulatory approval texas a lot faster so its id say like were -- well definitely have available at texas probably have it available california subject to regulatory approval then -- maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least california texas so thatd be very exciting theres really a profound change tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle battery manufacturing company at that point so we published our q3 vehicle safety report which shows one impact for every 7 million miles of autopilot that compares to us average of one crash roughly every 700000 miles so its currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to us average we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate needs of both fsd optimus were currently not a training compute constraint thats probably biggest factors that fsd actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes when you start getting to where it could take 10000 miles to find a mistake it takes a while to actually figure out which it -- this soccer ball better than -- soccer ball a better than soccer ball b it actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them are making mistakes or takes take a long time to make mistakes so thats actually single [indiscernible] based on many factors how long does it take us to figure out which version better so thats sort of high class problem obviously having a giant fleet very helpful for breaking this out then with optimus we show a massive improvement optimuss dexterity movement on october 10 our next-gen hand forearm which has 22 degrees of freedom double - which double prior hand forearm its extremely human like also its much better tactile sensing its really - i feel confident saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by long shot were moreover only company that really has all of ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots because things that what other companies are missing that theyre missing ai brain theyre missing ability to really scale to very high volume production so some have seen some impressive video demos but what but theyre [lacking is] (ph) localized ai [going] (ph) to scale volume to very high numbers as ive said on a few occasions before i think optimus will ultimately be most valuable product so i think it has a good chance of being most valuable product ever made for energy business thats doing extremely well theres opportunity ahead gigantic lathrop megapack factory reached 200 megapacks a week which now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate we have a second factory shanghai that will begin with a 20 gigawatt hour a year run rate q1 next year so next quarter that will also scale up it wont be long before were shipping a 100 gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at tesla thatll ultimately grow i think to multiple terawatt hours per year it has to actually order to have a sustainable energy future if youre not at terawatt scale youre not really moving needle so if you look at our admittedly very complicated last master plan which i think actually too much detail ill -- maybe ill ask [vaibhav] (ph) to analyze itunidentified company representative  sure elonelon musk can give us tldr on last master plan but we showed that last plan that it possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation batteries electric transport there are no fundamental material limitations like theres not some very rare material that we dont have enough of on earth we actually have enough of raw materials to yeah take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable even if civilization dramatically increased its electricity usage it would still be fully sustainable one way to think of progress of a civilization its based out a little esoteric but percentage completion of kardashev scale so kardashev scale 1 would be youre using all power of a planet we were were currently less than 1% on kardashev level 1 level 2 would be using all power of sun level 3 all power of galaxy so we have a long way to go long way to go when you think kardashev terms it becomes obvious that by far biggest source of energy sun everything else noise so conclusion tesla focused on building future of energy transport robotics ai this a time when others are just focused on managing around near term trends we think what were doing right approach if we execute on our objectives then i think we will tesla my prediction tesla will become most valuable company world probably by a long by a long shot i want to thank tesla team once again for strong execution a tough operating environment were looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future thank youtravis axelrod great thank you very much elon ill let vaibhav pass some more big remarks as wellvaibhav taneja yeah thanks our q3 results were positive once again demonstrate scale to which businesses evolved what they use with generation of record operating cash flows of $63 billion our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter year-on-year while we had unit volume growth we did experience reduction asps primarily due to impact of financing incentives as a reminder we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks financial institution recognize cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to them we released fsd for cybertruck other features like actually smart summon like elon talked about north america which contributed $326 million of revenues quarter we continue to see elevated levels of regular 2 week credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year to expand on this at an industrial level china continues to outperform us europe by a factor of three if there something to be learned from that this gives a signal of what to come other regions as customers acceptance of ev growth we feel that right strategy to build affordable more compelling leads our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a build-up of inventory to support this strategy were continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options every market when you compare any vehicle our lineup with other oems believe our vehicles provide much better value particularly when you consider safety features performance unparalleled software functionalities like david also talked about include also what ashok talked about around autonomy music options parental controls much more while every vehicle our lineup comes up with these capabilities there an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners we plan on making these more visible our interactions with both existing future customers automotive margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of a 50 features released discussed before increase our overall production delivery volume albeit benefit from marketing pricing more localized deliveries region which resulted lower freight duties sustaining these margins q4 however will be challenging given current economic environment note that we are focused on cost per vehicle there are numerous work streams within company to squeeze that cost without compromising on customer experienceelon musk yes im assuming thats a helpful -- hopefully a helpful macro trend if theres a decline in interest rates this has a massive effect on automotive demand vast majority of people or demand driven by monthly payment can they put monthly payment so like most likely well see continue to decline interest rates which helps with affordability vehiclesvaibhav taneja yeah i mean that one trend which we observed industry that because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates people are willing to take cars longer especially us that actually having an impact on all our industry too as we discussed earlier as we discussed impact orders energy deployments fluctuate quarter over quarter due to customer readiness location of orders being fulfilled not necessarily an indicator of demand or production within quarter while we did see a decline q3 we expect to grow our deployment sequentially q4 to end year with more than doubled of last year energy margins q3 were a record at more than 30% this a function of mix of projects being deployed quarter note that there will be fluctuation margins as we manage through deployments our inventory our pipeline backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots were doing our little best to keep up with demand just coming back on automotive margins i talked about -- sorry i talked about what happening one other thing which i want to also share that were -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to squeeze like i said before about squeezing out cost but this something which we also are very capable of i mean just q3 we reached our lowest cost per micro that a trend which we will keep focus on then going on to service other we continue to show improvements q3 this was a result of better performance both our service business which includes collision part sales merchandise continued growth supercharging these field based revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter a year on year basis this partially due to restructuring we undertook q2 cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase costs related to our ai efforts weve started using gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead of schedule are on track to get 50k gpus deployed texas by end of this month one thing which id like to elaborate that were being very judicious on our ai compute spend too saying how best we can utilize existing infrastructure before making further investments on capex front we had about $35 billion quarter this was a sequential increase largely because of investments ai compute we now expect our capex for year to be excess of $11 billion we shared our vision for future at real world event at beginning of month tesla team hyper focused on delivering on that version all efforts are underway to make it a reality while weve achieved significant progress this year it will take time to get this as we find a new incredibly complex technologies navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape future incredibly bright i want to thank tesla team once again for all their helpa - travis axelrod great thank you very much vaibhav now well go to investor questions first one is tesla still on track to deliver more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier how does it align with your ai product roadmaplars moravy sure i mean as elon vaibhav both said you are plan to meet that first half of next year our mission has always been to lower cost of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy transport part of that lowering cost for current vehicles which where all of personally owned vehicles that we sell today come but next stage that really it fits into ai roadmap when we bring robotaxis which lowers initial cost of getting into an ev those -- thats really where we see marriage of ev road map ai road mapelon musk yeah itll be with incentive sub-30k which kind of a key thresholdtravis axelrod great thank you very much similar question next when can we expect tesla to give us $25000 non-robotaxi regular car modelelon musk i think weve made very clear that were future autonomous it i mean i its going to be you know ive actually said this many years ago but that my strong belief i believe that panning out to be true so ill be very obvious retrospect that future autonomous electric vehicles non-autonomous gasoline vehicles future will be like riding a horse using a foot bone its not that there are no horses yeah there are some horses but theyre unusual theyre niche so it just everythings going to be electric autonomous i think this like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that that future so a lot of automotive companies or most automotive companies have not internalized this which surprising because weve been shouting this from rooftops for such a long time it will accrue to their detriment future but all of our vehicles future will be autonomous yes so all vehicles that weve really made all 7 million vehicles vast majority are capable of autonomy were currently making on order of 35000 autonomous vehicles a week compare that to say waymos entire fleet less than - theyve have less than a 1000 cars we make 35000 a weeklars moravy yeah our cars look normalelon musk yeah they mostly look normal cybertruck looks abnormal cybercab/robotaxi we wanted to have something futuristic working i think it does look futuristic its worth noting with respect to cybercab its not its especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution vehicle manufacturing that also coming with cybercab cycle time like the units per hour of cybercab line it -- like this just really something special i mean this probably a yeah half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines like not same league what im saying not same league so its -- i said like several years ago that -- maybe most i mean hottest tesla product to copy will be factory just like buy a factorylars moravy yeah camera versus near a factory thats up to my --elon musk yeah its like things yeah so as we so were rapidly evolving manufacturing technology so anyway theres like basically i think having a regular $25000 model pointless yeah it would be silly like itll be completely at odds with what we believelars moravy autonomous world but matters as well as cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle thats what weve done with robotaxielon musk exactly autonomous it its fully considered cost per mile what matters if you try to make a car that essentially a hybrid manual automatic cars its not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yeah -- cybercab just not going to have steering wheels pads its only designed to optimize for autonomy but now itll cost on order of cost roughly $25000 so it a $25000 car you can -- you will be able to buy one on an exclusive exclusively if you want so just what happens to your mobile phones you dont need ittravis axelrod great thank you very much next question what tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centersunidentified company representative  so we aim on solving problems at source so at factory before they can even affect our customers we believe best service no service our heads dont even have themelon musk if car doesnt break yeah thats best thingunidentified company representative exactly dont see any with test you either do it remote yeah fix issue upstream or do it remotely do it through software maybe being at work or at home car can be parked weve addressed fixed issue weve partnered field with service to make sure were looking at same issues additionally just q3 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total at nearly 70 locations north america weve significantly expand size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon musk yeah i think its like actually a lot of merit to having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor okay you can start to approach yeah it should be more factory like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service people its way easier for somebody to come expert a few different types of repairs than every repairunidentified company representative  exactly this has helped us with base set these heavy repairs clogging up lane theyve dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through a bit massively treating it like a factoryelon musk yes this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got a good feedback with our carsunidentified company representative  exactly if you were with factory with service leaders together send back people from factories that field to factory to see it firsthand suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon musk yeah so i view this as a structural -- fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industryunidentified company representative also do a bunch of work on software side not only to automate diagnostics so identifying what needs to be done to a car before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car to be very efficiently worked on once it arrives so parts are there like lift scheduled technicians schedule like everything thats what im saying this whats wrong with me tells us te,0.142487,positive

ride-hailing app but its something that weve made available to customers for years seeing progress on route mobile app thats something youll need for ride-hailing app but again we released it meantime so its not like were just starting to think about this stuff right now while were building out early stages of our ride-hailing network weve been thinking about this for quite a long time were excited to get functionality out thereelon musk yeah we do expect to roll out ride-hailing california texas next year to public but not california somewhat theres quite a long regulatory approval process i think we should get approval next year but its contingent upon regulatory approval texas a lot faster so its id say like were -- well definitely have available at texas probably have it available california subject to regulatory approval then -- maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least california texas so thatd be very exciting theres really a profound change tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle battery manufacturing company at that point so we published our q3 vehicle safety report which shows one impact for every 7 million miles of autopilot that compares to us average of one crash roughly every 700000 miles so its currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to us average we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate needs of both fsd optimus were currently not a training compute constraint thats probably biggest factors that fsd actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes when you start getting to where it could take 10000 miles to find a mistake it takes a while to actually figure out which it -- this soccer ball better than -- soccer ball a better than soccer ball b it actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them are making mistakes or takes take a long time to make mistakes so thats actually single [indiscernible] based on many factors how long does it take us to figure out which version better so thats sort of high class problem obviously having a giant fleet very helpful for breaking this out then with optimus we show a massive improvement optimuss dexterity movement on october 10 our next-gen hand forearm which has 22 degrees of freedom double - which double prior hand forearm its extremely human like also its much better tactile sensing its really - i feel confident saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by long shot were moreover only company that really has all of ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots because things that what other companies are missing that theyre missing ai brain theyre missing ability to really scale to very high volume production so some have seen some impressive video demos but what but theyre [lacking is] (ph) localized ai [going] (ph) to scale volume to very high numbers as ive said on a few occasions before i think optimus will ultimately be most valuable product so i think it has a good chance of being most valuable product ever made for energy business thats doing extremely well theres opportunity ahead gigantic lathrop megapack factory reached 200 megapacks a week which now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate we have a second factory shanghai that will begin with a 20 gigawatt hour a year run rate q1 next year so next quarter that will also scale up it wont be long before were shipping a 100 gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at tesla thatll ultimately grow i think to multiple terawatt hours per year it has to actually order to have a sustainable energy future if youre not at terawatt scale youre not really moving needle so if you look at our admittedly very complicated last master plan which i think actually too much detail ill -- maybe ill ask [vaibhav] (ph) to analyze itunidentified company representative  sure elonelon musk can give us tldr on last master plan but we showed that last plan that it possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation batteries electric transport there are no fundamental material limitations like theres not some very rare material that we dont have enough of on earth we actually have enough of raw materials to yeah take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable even if civilization dramatically increased its electricity usage it would still be fully sustainable one way to think of progress of a civilization its based out a little esoteric but percentage completion of kardashev scale so kardashev scale 1 would be youre using all power of a planet we were were currently less than 1% on kardashev level 1 level 2 would be using all power of sun level 3 all power of galaxy so we have a long way to go long way to go when you think kardashev terms it becomes obvious that by far biggest source of energy sun everything else noise so conclusion tesla focused on building future of energy transport robotics ai this a time when others are just focused on managing around near term trends we think what were doing right approach if we execute on our objectives then i think we will tesla my prediction tesla will become most valuable company world probably by a long by a long shot i want to thank tesla team once again for strong execution a tough operating environment were looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future thank youtravis axelrod great thank you very much elon ill let vaibhav pass some more big remarks as wellvaibhav taneja yeah thanks our q3 results were positive once again demonstrate scale to which businesses evolved what they use with generation of record operating cash flows of $63 billion our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter year-on-year while we had unit volume growth we did experience reduction asps primarily due to impact of financing incentives as a reminder we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks financial institution recognize cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to them we released fsd for cybertruck other features like actually smart summon like elon talked about north america which contributed $326 million of revenues quarter we continue to see elevated levels of regular 2 week credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year to expand on this at an industrial level china continues to outperform us europe by a factor of three if there something to be learned from that this gives a signal of what to come other regions as customers acceptance of ev growth we feel that right strategy to build affordable more compelling leads our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a build-up of inventory to support this strategy were continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options every market when you compare any vehicle our lineup with other oems believe our vehicles provide much better value particularly when you consider safety features performance unparalleled software functionalities like david also talked about include also what ashok talked about around autonomy music options parental controls much more while every vehicle our lineup comes up with these capabilities there an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners we plan on making these more visible our interactions with both existing future customers automotive margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of a 50 features released discussed before increase our overall production delivery volume albeit benefit from marketing pricing more localized deliveries region which resulted lower freight duties sustaining these margins q4 however will be challenging given current economic environment note that we are focused on cost per vehicle there are numerous work streams within company to squeeze that cost without compromising on customer experienceelon musk yes im assuming thats a helpful -- hopefully a helpful macro trend if theres a decline in interest rates this has a massive effect on automotive demand vast majority of people or demand driven by monthly payment can they put monthly payment so like most likely well see continue to decline interest rates which helps with affordability vehiclesvaibhav taneja yeah i mean that one trend which we observed industry that because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates people are willing to take cars longer especially us that actually having an impact on all our industry too as we discussed earlier as we discussed impact orders energy deployments fluctuate quarter over quarter due to customer readiness location of orders being fulfilled not necessarily an indicator of demand or production within quarter while we did see a decline q3 we expect to grow our deployment sequentially q4 to end year with more than doubled of last year energy margins q3 were a record at more than 30% this a function of mix of projects being deployed quarter note that there will be fluctuation margins as we manage through deployments our inventory our pipeline backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots were doing our little best to keep up with demand just coming back on automotive margins i talked about -- sorry i talked about what happening one other thing which i want to also share that were -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to squeeze like i said before about squeezing out cost but this something which we also are very capable of i mean just q3 we reached our lowest cost per micro that a trend which we will keep focus on then going on to service other we continue to show improvements q3 this was a result of better performance both our service business which includes collision part sales merchandise continued growth supercharging these field based revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter a year on year basis this partially due to restructuring we undertook q2 cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase costs related to our ai efforts weve started using gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead of schedule are on track to get 50k gpus deployed texas by end of this month one thing which id like to elaborate that were being very judicious on our ai compute spend too saying how best we can utilize existing infrastructure before making further investments on capex front we had about $35 billion quarter this was a sequential increase largely because of investments ai compute we now expect our capex for year to be excess of $11 billion we shared our vision for future at real world event at beginning of month tesla team hyper focused on delivering on that version all efforts are underway to make it a reality while weve achieved significant progress this year it will take time to get this as we find a new incredibly complex technologies navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape future incredibly bright i want to thank tesla team once again for all their helpa - travis axelrod great thank you very much vaibhav now well go to investor questions first one is tesla still on track to deliver more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier how does it align with your ai product roadmaplars moravy sure i mean as elon vaibhav both said you are plan to meet that first half of next year our mission has always been to lower cost of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy transport part of that lowering cost for current vehicles which where all of personally owned vehicles that we sell today come but next stage that really it fits into ai roadmap when we bring robotaxis which lowers initial cost of getting into an ev those -- thats really where we see marriage of ev road map ai road mapelon musk yeah itll be with incentive sub-30k which kind of a key thresholdtravis axelrod great thank you very much similar question next when can we expect tesla to give us $25000 non-robotaxi regular car modelelon musk i think weve made very clear that were future autonomous it i mean i its going to be you know ive actually said this many years ago but that my strong belief i believe that panning out to be true so ill be very obvious retrospect that future autonomous electric vehicles non-autonomous gasoline vehicles future will be like riding a horse using a foot bone its not that there are no horses yeah there are some horses but theyre unusual theyre niche so it just everythings going to be electric autonomous i think this like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that that future so a lot of automotive companies or most automotive companies have not internalized this which surprising because weve been shouting this from rooftops for such a long time it will accrue to their detriment future but all of our vehicles future will be autonomous yes so all vehicles that weve really made all 7 million vehicles vast majority are capable of autonomy were currently making on order of 35000 autonomous vehicles a week compare that to say waymos entire fleet less than - theyve have less than a 1000 cars we make 35000 a weeklars moravy yeah our cars look normalelon musk yeah they mostly look normal cybertruck looks abnormal cybercab/robotaxi we wanted to have something futuristic working i think it does look futuristic its worth noting with respect to cybercab its not its especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution vehicle manufacturing that also coming with cybercab cycle time like the units per hour of cybercab line it -- like this just really something special i mean this probably a yeah half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines like not same league what im saying not same league so its -- i said like several years ago that -- maybe most i mean hottest tesla product to copy will be factory just like buy a factorylars moravy yeah camera versus near a factory thats up to my --elon musk yeah its like things yeah so as we so were rapidly evolving manufacturing technology so anyway theres like basically i think having a regular $25000 model pointless yeah it would be silly like itll be completely at odds with what we believelars moravy autonomous world but matters as well as cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle thats what weve done with robotaxielon musk exactly autonomous it its fully considered cost per mile what matters if you try to make a car that essentially a hybrid manual automatic cars its not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yeah -- cybercab just not going to have steering wheels pads its only designed to optimize for autonomy but now itll cost on order of cost roughly $25000 so it a $25000 car you can -- you will be able to buy one on an exclusive exclusively if you want so just what happens to your mobile phones you dont need ittravis axelrod great thank you very much next question what tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centersunidentified company representative  so we aim on solving problems at source so at factory before they can even affect our customers we believe best service no service our heads dont even have themelon musk if car doesnt break yeah thats best thingunidentified company representative exactly dont see any with test you either do it remote yeah fix issue upstream or do it remotely do it through software maybe being at work or at home car can be parked weve addressed fixed issue weve partnered field with service to make sure were looking at same issues additionally just q3 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total at nearly 70 locations north america weve significantly expand size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon musk yeah i think its like actually a lot of merit to having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor okay you can start to approach yeah it should be more factory like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service people its way easier for somebody to come expert a few different types of repairs than every repairunidentified company representative  exactly this has helped us with base set these heavy repairs clogging up lane theyve dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through a bit massively treating it like a factoryelon musk yes this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got a good feedback with our carsunidentified company representative  exactly if you were with factory with service leaders together send back people from factories that field to factory to see it firsthand suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon musk yeah so i view this as a structural -- fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industryunidentified company representative also do a bunch of work on software side not only to automate diagnostics so identifying what needs to be done to a car before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car to be very efficiently worked on once it arrives so parts are there like lift scheduled technicians schedule like everything thats what im saying this whats wrong with me tells us te,0.142487,positive
114,2024-10-31,why tesla model y juniper will be a big deal,for many years tesla has owned electric vehicle space many countries where it has its presence but even more so us fact it took until q2 2024 for teslas ev market share to drop below 50-percent for first time over a decade tesla relies on a solid combination of luxury appeal sensible pricing with evs for most budgets teslas also perform well market with solid battery life charge times performance perhaps excluding several disasters that have gone on with cybertruck remove adswhile teslas ceo elon musk may be a divisive controversial figure its undeniable that company itself has experienced a tremendous amount of success past 10 years us public absolutely love with crossovers a phenomenon that has only grown 2020s for tesla this really no different while model s brought tesla into mainstream with its sleek luxury sedan offering model y has taken over model y teslas budget crossover for masses tesla now working on an update to model y something that big news ev space heres why this such a big dealthis a list about an upcoming vehicle that has not been completely revealed yet while we make every attempt to verify facts back up any speculation information provided below may not be entirely accurate or may change prior to a vehicles release we will make every effort to update this content with new developments as they arise all information contained here was obtained from authoritative sources including tesla motortrend remove adsrelatedheres why you should wait for tesla model y juniperthe juniper update a long way away but there are a lot of reasons as to why this model y update may be worth wait1 model y one of best selling cars worldteslas model y was literally best-selling car world 2023 not best-selling ev world not best-selling car united states best-selling automobile on entire planet this not just a triumph for tesla brand but a triumph for electric vehicles if an ev can beat a reliable japanese sedan or american pickup truck that means world has changed not just its mind but its entire infrastructure regarding electrified vehiclesa refresh for one of most popular cars of 2020s automatically a big dealnew model formats can lead to bumps sales toyota corolla was refreshed 2020 it quickly became best-selling car world by 2022 as a leader evs juniper will likely inform design style pricing for all electric crossovers coming years teslas ability to experiment with makes like cybertruck new roadster relies on performance of model y as it breadwinner for company remove adswith chinese companies constantly pushing out cheap cheerful electric vehicles model y remains most important car tesla stable if juniper a flop it could spell disaster for brand musk company do not want to see model y go way of taurus2 juniper could see some tweaks to powertrainone of most exciting things about model refreshes changes to performance with internal combustion cars this typically about new engines whether they add or remove cylinders or throw a turbocharger but with evs this can be a little more subtle obviously number of electric motors can change on an ev but improvements to power may not come off as flashy as their ice counterparts however teslas model 3 highland update might give some insight into whats coming for juniper remove adsthe current model y can get up to 456 horses; will juniper be more powerfulthe model y currently offers 295 384 456 horsepower models its standard long range performance specs new model 3 performance provides 510 horses a jump from 455 horsepower of previous spec but base performance remained same this likely means that base performance will remain same juniper but we could see a jump power for performance model tesla has not discussed any kind of off-road specs so do not expect a new drivetrain to be built to go over rough terrainwhile we can only speculate on what new power plant for model y juniper will look like based on model 3s changes a more powerful model likely to come it wouldnt really make sense for new model to not bring something new to table would itrelatedtesla model y juniper production reportedly starts shanghaithe best-selling vehicle world need of an update tesla might have started production secretly remove ads3 current model y getting long tooththe model y debuted 2020 to great reviews even greater sales while tweaks have been made like removal of radar for adaptive cruise control or a change to camera-based self-parking a full overhaul has yet to occur with ev market growing more more crowded a four-year-old car could quickly become something of a relic thus juniper had to come sooner rather than latertesla has not updated crossover since releasetesla refresh cycles are rather new with company only transitioning away from being a boutique automaker last 10 years based on model 3 model s it looks like four to six years sweet spot for tesla refreshes ice cars from major automakers typically go closer to six to eight years their cycles based on popular models like toyota camry or rav4 remove adstesla needs to stay ahead of game to maintain its shrinking dominance of ev sphere letting its most popular model stagnate would not be a conducive way to keep ahead of up comers kia hyundai have made huge splashes recent years so its about time for tesla to make another splash of its ownadd topspeed to your google news feedfollow ongoogle news4 a new interior likely cominganother great thing about refreshes cars changes to interior new technology updated layouts advanced consoles are abound ever-changing world of car design tesla of course loves its new technology its a safe bet to say that model y juniper will feature a new interior setup of its own once again well take a look at what model 3 highland updated let you know how it might compare to juniper remove adstesla all on digital touch displaysthe model 3 added a gigantic 154-inch touch infotainment system front it also added an eight-inch system rear it features a new multi-function steering wheel brand new adjustable seats with heat ventilation options model 3 featured two wireless phone chargers beneath infotainment systemwhile these are simply features of model 3 it likely that they will carry over to model y like has happened past tesla clearly set on providing best infotainment systems available for its drivers passengers evs are seemingly having an arms race on gigantic infotainment screens tesla will not be left dustrelatedheres how long it takes to charge a tesla model y (and how much it costs)the tesla model y returns some of lowest energy charging costs thanks to its low-efficiency estimates5 juniper will likely be a tesla tech showcase remove adstesla claims to be at forefront of driving technology with its full self driving tech it boasts among most advanced automated driving systems on road (whether thats actually true remains to be seen) tesla currently being beaten to market driverless cars by waymo which a little embarrassing after elon musk claimed tesla would provide driverless options as early as 2023 so we expect tesla to show off a little model yas teslas most popular model tesla will show off its newest tech updatestesla planning to release v13 of its fsd tech sometime november this leaves a good amount of time to release another overhaul time for junipers release next year tesla plans to roll out robotaxis as early as 2026 juniper which will be a fully autonomous vehicle available for consumer purchase its likely we could see some of technology included robotaxi featured model y with competitors like ford charging half as much for a hands-free driving experience tesla likely feeling heat to either improve their service with new technology or at a bear minimum make any updated features cheaper remove adstesla needs its most popular car to shine on technological front we expect to see all shiniest most state-of-the-art software hardware available time for juniper tesla stakes its reputation as a leader that field after all6 juniper important for current buyersa new model announcement always sends shockwaves through market for older version news of a better shinier car can put people off of buying stock that already exists this becomes a problem for carmaker where they fear a drop sales then have to either cut prices or offer better incentives for purchase fact elon musk had to dispel rumors that juniper would release 2025 order to help sales a tweet or erm x he also deleted a post where he directly admitted rumors hurt sales remove adswith tesla offering low rates free self-driving current model its going to be hard to waittesla currently offering 30 days free of fsd which might entice customers to purchase subscription if they find it to their liking tesla also offering 0-percent apr for buyers who purchase fsd subscription other financing options include $0 down when applying federal ev tax credit at purchaseconsidering updated model 3 did experience a moderate price jump these attractive financing offers may tempt buyers into purchasing current model y however siren song of new features an overhauled car could also be too tempting for some clearly tesla sees junipers premature release rumors as a threat to current sales has put on an offensive to combat a drop-off remove adsrelatedwill tesla model y juniper be more expensivewith tesla model y juniper coming to market soon there question of how much extra this should cost when it debuts with model 3 highland refresh we saw a bit of a price jump although it wasnt worth losing your mind over do you think this trend will continue with project juniper how much do you think this new suv will come at7 model y teslas most important caras weve mentioned tesla sees model y as breadwinner of brand it drives most sales keeps coffers full it not just a big seller america but also internationally lets break down just how much it drives teslas sales globallythe model y only tesla model that competes with chinese evsthe model y sold 12 million of teslas 18 million global sales 2023 accounting for 2/3 of companys global sales only about 394000 of those sales were united states meaning about 2/3 of all model y sales occurred internationally tesla sold over 654000 cars us 2023 meaning over 1/2 of them were model ys this also means that about 7 of every 10 teslas sold outside us a model y model y was also top-selling ev china largest ev market world remove adswith tesla directly competing with chinese automakers pushing out evs constantly ones that are often much more affordable than model y it quite a feat that american automobile has been most successful huge ev space model ys continued success global especially chinese market crucial to teslas success as a brand thus juniper will have to continue to have cosmopolitan appeal model y currently possess8 juniper may have an updated exterior remove adsarguably most important part of a model refresh exterior if a car looks terrible its redesign then it can help doom model like what happened to ford taurus or mitsubishi gallant a stylish new model can also bring a make to new heights popularity like what happened with ford focus while tesla has been careful to hide design changes test appearances on public roads we can once again look to model 3 highland as a preview for what may be coming with juniperall test photos have featured camouflage to hide design changesthe highland made front end sleeker more streamlined than previous model 3 we should expect a similar redesign with juniper especially since those same panels are ones hidden test photos model 3 highland offered 2 new paint colors stealth gray ultra red it seems likely theyll be available on model y juniper as well we also got new wheel options for highland could they be available for juniper updated model 3 got an improvement to moonroof dont be surprised if updated model y gets one as well remove adsonce again looking at model ys smaller sibling should give us some insight into what will change on juniper will changes be identical probably not however tesla does carry a unified design philosophy for all of its vehicles our opinion new panels look quite nice as well nothing wrong with a facelift done rightas most important car teslas offerings model y juniper will be one of most significant rollouts for tesla 2025 with production allegedly already begun shanghai it seems juniper full steam ahead ready to go to market while its not exactly a ground up overhaul like some automakers do tesla has a ton of pressure to make sure its cars steadily improve as ev market continues to get more more players were

position these insights can be particularly valuable given teslas complex business model its ambitious plans for futuretravis axelrod good afternoon everyone welcome to teslas third quarter 2024 q&a webcast my name travis axelrod head of investor relations i am joined today by elon musk vaibhav taneja a number of other executives our q3 results were announced at about 3 pm central time update deck we published at same link as this webcast during this call we will discuss our business outlook make forward-looking statements these comments are based on our predictions expectations as of today actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks uncertainties including those mentioned our most recent filings with sec during question-and-answer portion of todays call please limit yourself to one question one follow-up please use raise hand button to join question queue before we jump into q&a elon has some opening remarks elonelon musk thank you so to recap something that [indiscernible] industry ive seen year-over-year declines order volumes q3 tesla at same time has achieved record deliveries fact i think if you look at ev companies worldwide to best of my knowledge no ev company even profitable im not - to best of my knowledge there was no ev division of any company of any existing auto company that profitable so it notable that tesla profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment this quarter actually a record q3 for us so we produced our 7-millionth vehicle actually just yesterday so congratulations to teams that made it happen tesla thats staggeringly immense amount of work to make 7million cars so lets see we also have energy storage business growing like wildfire with strong demand for both megapack powerwall as people know on october 10th we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that i think very compelling so tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an opportunity to experience future where you have humanoid robots walking among crowd not with a canned video presentation or anything but literally walking among crowd serving drinks whatnot we had 50 autonomous vehicles there were 20 cybercabs but there were an additional 30 model ys operating fully autonomously entire night carrying thousands of peoples [indiscernible] with no incidents entire night so -- for those who went there that -- its worth emphasizing that these cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator pedals meaning there was no -- theres no -- there was no way for anyone to intervene manually even if they wanted to whole night went very smoothly so regarding vehicle business we are still on-track to deliver more affordable models starting first half of 2025 this i think probably people are wondering what should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year at risk of - to take a bit of risk here i do want to give some rough estimate which i think its 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year notwithstanding negative external events like if theres some force majeure events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that then we cant overcome massive force majeure events but i think with our lower cost vehicles with advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year my best guess then cybercab reaching volume production 26 i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 so just starting production reaching volume production 26 thats -- that should be substantial were aiming for at least 2 million units a year of cybercab thatll be more than one factory but i think its at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimately so yeah these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses that those are my best guesses cell 4680 lines team actually doing great work there 4680 rapidly approaching point where it most competitive set so when you consider fully landed - cost of a battery pack fully landed us net of incentives duties 4680 tracking to be most competitive meaning lower cost [indiscernible] considered than any other alternative were not quite there yet but were close to being there which i think extremely exciting weve got several - a lot of ideas to go well beyond that so if i think theres -- if we execute well 4680 will have -- tesla internally produced cell will be most cost competitive cell north america a testament to a tremendous amount of hard work there by team so thats - well continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors our intent not to make to provide to make cells just internally so i dont want to set off any alarm bells here were also increasing substantially our vehicle output our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cells most of them will still come from suppliers but i think it some good news that tesla internal cell likely - tracking to be most competitive us so with respect to autonomy as people are experiencing cars really from week-to-week there are significant improvements miles between interventions so with new version 125 release of full self-driving cybertruck combining code into a single stack so that city driving entering highway driving are one stack which a bigger burden for highway driving so its just all neural nets release of actually smart summon were trying to have a sense of humor here were also -- so that thats 125 version 13 of fsd going out soon ashok will elaborate more on that later call we expect to see some roughly a 5 or 6 fold improvement miles between interventions compared to 125 looking at year as a whole improvement miles between interventions we think will be at least three orders of magnitude so thats a very dramatic improvement course of year we expect that trend to continue next year so current internal expectation for tesla fsd having longer miles between intervention than human second quarter of next year which means it may end up being third quarter but its next - it seems extremely likely to be next year ashok do you want to add anythingashok elluswamy yeah miles between critical interventions yep like you mentioned elon we already made a 100x improvement with 125 from starting of this year then with v13 release we expect to be a 1000x from beginning - from january of this year on production [indiscernible] software this came because technology improvements going to end-to-end having higher frame rate partly also helped by hardware force more capabilities so on we hope that we continue to scale neural network data training compute et cetera by q2 next year we should cross over average human miles per critical intervention call it collision that caseelon musk so thats not sandbagging or anything else our internal estimate q2 of next year to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter so a vast majority of humanity has no idea that teslas drive themselves so especially for something like a model 3 or model y it looks like a normal car so you dont expect normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself cybercab looks different cybertruck looks different but model y model 3 look theyre good looking cars but look i think look fairly normal you dont expect a fairly normal looking car to have intelligence enough ai to be able to drive itself but it does so we do want to expose that to more people so were doing every time we have a significant improvement software well roll out another sort of 30 day trial so to encourage people to try it again we are seeing a significant improvement adoption so take rate for fsd has improved substantially especially after 10/10 event so theres no need to wait for a robo-taxi or cybercab to experience full autonomy we expect to achieve that next year with -- with our existing vehicle lineashok elluswamy one point actually smart summon gives a small taste of what its going to look like car able to drive itself to user within private parking lots currently its speed limited but then its going to quickly be increased we already had more than 1 million usage [indiscernible] of smart summonelon musk yep so we actually we have for tesla employees bay area we already are offering a ride-hailing capability so you can actually with development app you can request a ride itll take you anywhere bay area we do have a safety driver for now but software required to do that weve developed i mean david do you want to elaborate on thatunidentified company representative  yeah sure david we showed some screenshots of this q1 shareholder deck yeah this real weve been testing it for better part of year building blocks that we needed order to build this functionality deliver it to production weve been thinking about working on for years it just so happens that weve used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers meantime such as sharing your profile synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into whether its another car that you own or a car that somebodys loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into it looks exactly like yours everythings synchronized seat mirror positions media navigation everything same just what you would expect from one of our robotaxis but we gave that functionality to our customers right now because we built it intending for it to be used future were releasing that functionality now all -- then cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality sending a navigation to destination from your phone to vehicle so were doing that now with ride-hailing app but its something that weve made available to customers for years seeing progress on route mobile app thats something youll need for ride-hailing app but again we released it meantime so its not like were just starting to think about this stuff right now while were building out early stages of our ride-hailing network weve been thinking about this for quite a long time were excited to get functionality out thereelon musk yeah we do expect to roll out ride-hailing california texas next year to public but not california somewhat theres quite a long regulatory approval process i think we should get approval next year but its contingent upon regulatory approval texas a lot faster so its id say like were -- well definitely have available at texas probably have it available california subject to regulatory approval then -- maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least california texas so thatd be very exciting theres really a profound change tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle battery manufacturing company at that point so we published our q3 vehicle safety report which shows one impact for every 7 million miles of autopilot that compares to us average of one crash roughly every 700000 miles so its currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to us average we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate needs of both fsd optimus were currently not a training compute constraint thats probably biggest factors that fsd actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes when you start getting to where it could take 10000 miles to find a mistake it takes a while to actually figure out which it -- this soccer ball better than -- soccer ball a better than soccer ball b it actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them are making mistakes or takes take a long time to make mistakes so thats actually single [indiscernible] based on many factors how long does it take us to figure out which version better so thats sort of high class problem obviously having a giant fleet very helpful for breaking this out then with optimus we show a massive improvement optimuss dexterity movement on october 10 our next-gen hand forearm which has 22 degrees of freedom double - which double prior hand forearm its extremely human like also its much better tactile sensing its really - i feel confident saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by long shot were moreover only company that really has all of ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots because things that what other companies are missing that theyre missing ai brain theyre missing ability to really scale to very high volume production so some have seen some impressive video demos but what but theyre [lacking is] (ph) localized ai [going] (ph) to scale volume to very high numbers as ive said on a few occasions before i think optimus will ultimately be most valuable product so i think it has a good chance of being most valuable product ever made for energy business thats doing extremely well theres opportunity ahead gigantic lathrop megapack factory reached 200 megapacks a week which now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate we have a second factory shanghai that will begin with a 20 gigawatt hour a year run rate q1 next year so next quarter that will also scale up it wont be long before were shipping a 100 gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at tesla thatll ultimately grow i think to multiple terawatt hours per year it has to actually order to have a sustainable energy future if youre not at terawatt scale youre not really moving needle so if you look at our admittedly very complicated last master plan which i think actually too much detail ill -- maybe ill ask [vaibhav] (ph) to analyze itunidentified company representative  sure elonelon musk can give us tldr on last master plan but we showed that last plan that it possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation batteries electric transport there are no fundamental material limitations like theres not some very rare material that we dont have enough of on earth we actually have enough of raw materials to yeah take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable even if civilization dramatically increased its electricity usage it would still be fully sustainable one way to think of progress of a civilization its based out a little esoteric but percentage completion of kardashev scale so kardashev scale 1 would be youre using all power of a planet we were were currently less than 1% on kardashev level 1 level 2 would be using all power of sun level 3 all power of galaxy so we have a long way to go long way to go when you think kardashev terms it becomes obvious that by far biggest source of energy sun everything else noise so conclusion tesla focused on building future of energy transport robotics ai this a time when others are just focused on managing around near term trends we think what were doing right approach if we execute on our objectives then i think we will tesla my prediction tesla will become most valuable company world probably by a long by a long shot i want to thank tesla team once again for strong execution a tough operating environment were looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future thank youtravis axelrod great thank you very much elon ill let vaibhav pass some more big remarks as wellvaibhav taneja yeah thanks our q3 results were positive once again demonstrate scale to which businesses evolved what they use with generation of record operating cash flows of $63 billion our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter year-on-year while we had unit volume growth we did experience reduction asps primarily due to impact of financing incentives as a reminder we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks financial institution recognize cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to them we released fsd for cybertruck other features like actually smart summon like elon talked about north america which contributed $326 million of revenues quarter we continue to see elevated levels of regular 2 week credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year to expand on this at an industrial level china continues to outperform us europe by a factor of three if there something to be learned from that this gives a signal of what to come other regions as customers acceptance of ev growth we feel that right strategy to build affordable more compelling leads our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a build-up of inventory to support this strategy were continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options every market when you compare any vehicle our lineup with other oems believe our vehicles provide much better value particularly when you consider safety features performance unparalleled software functionalities like david also talked about include also what ashok talked about around autonomy music options parental controls much more while every vehicle our lineup comes up with these capabilities there an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners we plan on making these more visible our interactions with both existing future customers automotive margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of a 50 features released discussed before increase our overall production delivery volume albeit benefit from marketing pricing more localized deliveries region which resulted lower freight duties sustaining these margins q4 however will be challenging given current economic environment note that we are focused on cost per vehicle there are numerous work streams within company to squeeze that cost without compromising on customer experienceelon musk yes im assuming thats a helpful -- hopefully a helpful macro trend if theres a decline in interest rates this has a massive effect on automotive demand vast majority of people or demand driven by monthly payment can they put monthly payment so like most likely well see continue to decline interest rates which helps with affordability vehiclesvaibhav taneja yeah i mean that one trend which we observed industry that because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates people are willing to take cars longer especially us that actually having an impact on all our industry too as we discussed earlier as we discussed impact orders energy deployments fluctuate quarter over quarter due to customer readiness location of orders being fulfilled not necessarily an indicator of demand or production within quarter while we did see a decline q3 we expect to grow our deployment sequentially q4 to end year with more than doubled of last year energy margins q3 were a record at more than 30% this a function of mix of projects being deployed quarter note that there will be fluctuation margins as we manage through deployments our inventory our pipeline backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots were doing our little best to keep up with demand just coming back on automotive margins i talked about -- sorry i talked about what happening one other thing which i want to also share that were -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to squeeze like i said before about squeezing out cost but this something which we also are very capable of i mean just q3 we reached our lowest cost per micro that a trend which we will keep focus on then going on to service other we continue to show improvements q3 this was a result of better performance both our service business which includes collision part sales merchandise continued growth supercharging these field based revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter a year on year basis this partially due to restructuring we undertook q2 cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase costs related to our ai efforts weve started using gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead of schedule are on track to get 50k gpus deployed texas by end of this month one thing which id like to elaborate that were being very judicious on our ai compute spend too saying how best we can utilize existing infrastructure before making further investments on capex front we had about $35 billion quarter this was a sequential increase largely because of investments ai compute we now expect our capex for year to be excess of $11 billion we shared our vision for future at real world event at beginning of month tesla team hyper focused on delivering on that version all efforts are underway to make it a reality while weve achieved significant progress this year it will take time to get this as we find a new incredibly complex technologies navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape future incredibly bright i want to thank tesla team once again for all their helpa - travis axelrod great thank you very much vaibhav now well go to investor questions first one is tesla still on track to deliver more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier how does it align with your ai product roadmaplars moravy sure i mean as elon vaibhav both said you are plan to meet that first half of next year our mission has always been to lower cost of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy transport part of that lowering cost for current vehicles which where all of personally owned vehicles that we sell today come but next stage that really it fits into ai roadmap when we bring robotaxis which lowers initial cost of getting into an ev those -- thats really where we see marriage of ev road map ai road mapelon musk yeah itll be with incentive sub-30k which kind of a key thresholdtravis axelrod great thank you very much similar question next when can we expect tesla to give us $25000 non-robotaxi regular car modelelon musk i think weve made very clear that were future autonomous it i mean i its going to be you know ive actually said this many years ago but that my strong belief i believe that panning out to be true so ill be very obvious retrospect that future autonomous electric vehicles non-autonomous gasoline vehicles future will be like riding a horse using a foot bone its not that there are no horses yeah there are some horses but theyre unusual theyre niche so it just everythings going to be electric autonomous i think this like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that that future so a lot of automotive companies or most automotive companies have not internalized this which surprising because weve been shouting this from rooftops for such a long time it will accrue to their detriment future but all of our vehicles future will be autonomous yes so all vehicles that weve really made all 7 million vehicles vast majority are capable of autonomy were currently making on order of 35000 autonomous vehicles a week compare that to say waymos entire fleet less than - theyve have less than a 1000 cars we make 35000 a weeklars moravy yeah our cars look normalelon musk yeah they mostly look normal cybertruck looks abnormal cybercab/robotaxi we wanted to have something futuristic working i think it does look futuristic its worth noting with respect to cybercab its not its especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution vehicle manufacturing that also coming with cybercab cycle time like the units per hour of cybercab line it -- like this just really something special i mean this probably a yeah half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines like not same league what im saying not same league so its -- i said like several years ago that -- maybe most i mean hottest tesla product to copy will be factory just like buy a factorylars moravy yeah camera versus near a factory thats up to my --elon musk yeah its like things yeah so as we so were rapidly evolving manufacturing technology so anyway theres like basically i think having a regular $25000 model pointless yeah it would be silly like itll be completely at odds with what we believelars moravy autonomous world but matters as well as cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle thats what weve done with robotaxielon musk exactly autonomous it its fully considered cost per mile what matters if you try to make a car that essentially a hybrid manual automatic cars its not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yeah -- cybercab just not going to have steering wheels pads its only designed to optimize for autonomy but now itll cost on order of cost roughly $25000 so it a $25000 car you can -- you will be able to buy one on an exclusive exclusively if you want so just what happens to your mobile phones you dont need ittravis axelrod great thank you very much next question what tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centersunidentified company representative  so we aim on solving problems at source so at factory before they can even affect our customers we believe best service no service our heads dont even have themelon musk if car doesnt break yeah thats best thingunidentified company representative exactly dont see any with test you either do it remote yeah fix issue upstream or do it remotely do it through software maybe being at work or at home car can be parked weve addressed fixed issue weve partnered field with service to make sure were looking at same issues additionally just q3 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total at nearly 70 locations north america weve significantly expand size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon musk yeah i think its like actually a lot of merit to having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor okay you can start to approach yeah it should be more factory like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service people its way easier for somebody to come expert a few different types of repairs than every repairunidentified company representative  exactly this has helped us with base set these heavy repairs clogging up lane theyve dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through a bit massively treating it like a factoryelon musk yes this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got a good feedback with our carsunidentified company representative  exactly if you were with factory with service leaders together send back people from factories that field to factory to see it firsthand suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon musk yeah so i view this as a structural -- fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industryunidentified company representative also do a bunch of work on software side not only to automate diagnostics so identifying what needs to be done to a car before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car to be very efficiently worked on once it arrives so parts are there like lift scheduled technicians schedule like everything thats what im saying this whats wrong with me tells us tell service centerunidentified company representative  car everything ready vanelon musk yeah please fix me this whats wronguniden,0.142604,positive

webcast my name travis axelrod head of investor relations i am joined today by elon musk vaibhav taneja a number of other executives our q3 results were announced at about 3 pm central time update deck we published at same link as this webcast during this call we will discuss our business outlook make forward-looking statements these comments are based on our predictions expectations as of today actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks uncertainties including those mentioned our most recent filings with sec during question-and-answer portion of todays call please limit yourself to one question one follow-up please use raise hand button to join question queue before we jump into q&a elon has some opening remarks elonelon musk thank you so to recap something that [indiscernible] industry ive seen year-over-year declines order volumes q3 tesla at same time has achieved record deliveries fact i think if you look at ev companies worldwide to best of my knowledge no ev company even profitable im not - to best of my knowledge there was no ev division of any company of any existing auto company that profitable so it notable that tesla profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment this quarter actually a record q3 for us so we produced our 7-millionth vehicle actually just yesterday so congratulations to teams that made it happen tesla thats staggeringly immense amount of work to make 7million cars so lets see we also have energy storage business growing like wildfire with strong demand for both megapack powerwall as people know on october 10th we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that i think very compelling so tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an opportunity to experience future where you have humanoid robots walking among crowd not with a canned video presentation or anything but literally walking among crowd serving drinks whatnot we had 50 autonomous vehicles there were 20 cybercabs but there were an additional 30 model ys operating fully autonomously entire night carrying thousands of peoples [indiscernible] with no incidents entire night so -- for those who went there that -- its worth emphasizing that these cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator pedals meaning there was no -- theres no -- there was no way for anyone to intervene manually even if they wanted to whole night went very smoothly so regarding vehicle business we are still on-track to deliver more affordable models starting first half of 2025 this i think probably people are wondering what should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year at risk of - to take a bit of risk here i do want to give some rough estimate which i think its 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year notwithstanding negative external events like if theres some force majeure events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that then we cant overcome massive force majeure events but i think with our lower cost vehicles with advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year my best guess then cybercab reaching volume production 26 i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 so just starting production reaching volume production 26 thats -- that should be substantial were aiming for at least 2 million units a year of cybercab thatll be more than one factory but i think its at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimately so yeah these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses that those are my best guesses cell 4680 lines team actually doing great work there 4680 rapidly approaching point where it most competitive set so when you consider fully landed - cost of a battery pack fully landed us net of incentives duties 4680 tracking to be most competitive meaning lower cost [indiscernible] considered than any other alternative were not quite there yet but were close to being there which i think extremely exciting weve got several - a lot of ideas to go well beyond that so if i think theres -- if we execute well 4680 will have -- tesla internally produced cell will be most cost competitive cell north america a testament to a tremendous amount of hard work there by team so thats - well continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors our intent not to make to provide to make cells just internally so i dont want to set off any alarm bells here were also increasing substantially our vehicle output our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cells most of them will still come from suppliers but i think it some good news that tesla internal cell likely - tracking to be most competitive us so with respect to autonomy as people are experiencing cars really from week-to-week there are significant improvements miles between interventions so with new version 125 release of full self-driving cybertruck combining code into a single stack so that city driving entering highway driving are one stack which a bigger burden for highway driving so its just all neural nets release of actually smart summon were trying to have a sense of humor here were also -- so that thats 125 version 13 of fsd going out soon ashok will elaborate more on that later call we expect to see some roughly a 5 or 6 fold improvement miles between interventions compared to 125 looking at year as a whole improvement miles between interventions we think will be at least three orders of magnitude so thats a very dramatic improvement course of year we expect that trend to continue next year so current internal expectation for tesla fsd having longer miles between intervention than human second quarter of next year which means it may end up being third quarter but its next - it seems extremely likely to be next year ashok do you want to add anythingashok elluswamy yeah miles between critical interventions yep like you mentioned elon we already made a 100x improvement with 125 from starting of this year then with v13 release we expect to be a 1000x from beginning - from january of this year on production [indiscernible] software this came because technology improvements going to end-to-end having higher frame rate partly also helped by hardware force more capabilities so on we hope that we continue to scale neural network data training compute et cetera by q2 next year we should cross over average human miles per critical intervention call it collision that caseelon musk so thats not sandbagging or anything else our internal estimate q2 of next year to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter so a vast majority of humanity has no idea that teslas drive themselves so especially for something like a model 3 or model y it looks like a normal car so you dont expect normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself cybercab looks different cybertruck looks different but model y model 3 look theyre good looking cars but look i think look fairly normal you dont expect a fairly normal looking car to have intelligence enough ai to be able to drive itself but it does so we do want to expose that to more people so were doing every time we have a significant improvement software well roll out another sort of 30 day trial so to encourage people to try it again we are seeing a significant improvement adoption so take rate for fsd has improved substantially especially after 10/10 event so theres no need to wait for a robo-taxi or cybercab to experience full autonomy we expect to achieve that next year with -- with our existing vehicle lineashok elluswamy one point actually smart summon gives a small taste of what its going to look like car able to drive itself to user within private parking lots currently its speed limited but then its going to quickly be increased we already had more than 1 million usage [indiscernible] of smart summonelon musk yep so we actually we have for tesla employees bay area we already are offering a ride-hailing capability so you can actually with development app you can request a ride itll take you anywhere bay area we do have a safety driver for now but software required to do that weve developed i mean david do you want to elaborate on thatunidentified company representative  yeah sure david we showed some screenshots of this q1 shareholder deck yeah this real weve

little best to keep up with demand just coming back on automotive margins i talked about -- sorry i talked about what happening one other thing which i want to also share that were -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to squeeze like i said before about squeezing out cost but this something which we also are very capable of i mean just q3 we reached our lowest cost per micro that a trend which we will keep focus on then going on to service other we continue to show improvements q3 this was a result of better performance both our service business which includes collision part sales merchandise continued growth supercharging these field based revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter a year on year basis this partially due to restructuring we undertook q2 cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase costs related to our ai efforts weve started using gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead of schedule are on track to get 50k gpus deployed texas by end of this month one thing which id like to elaborate that were being very judicious on our ai compute spend too saying how best we can utilize existing infrastructure before making further investments on capex front we had about $35 billion quarter this was a sequential increase largely because of investments ai compute we now expect our capex for year to be excess of $11 billion we shared our vision for future at real world event at beginning of month tesla team hyper focused on delivering on that version all efforts are underway to make it a reality while weve achieved significant progress this year it will take time to get this as we find a new incredibly complex technologies navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape future incredibly bright i want to thank tesla team once again for all their helpa - travis axelrod great thank you very much vaibhav now well go to investor questions first one is tesla still on track to deliver more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier how does it align with your ai product roadmaplars moravy sure i mean as elon vaibhav both said you are plan to meet that first half of next year our mission has always been to lower cost of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy transport part of that lowering cost for current vehicles which where all of personally owned vehicles that we sell today come but next stage that really it fits into ai roadmap when we bring robotaxis which lowers initial cost of getting into an ev those -- thats really where we see marriage of ev road map ai road mapelon musk yeah itll be with incentive sub-30k which kind of a key thresholdtravis axelrod great thank you very much similar question next when can we expect tesla to give us $25000 non-robotaxi regular car modelelon musk i think weve made very clear that were future autonomous it i mean i its going to be you know ive actually said this many years ago but that my strong belief i believe that panning out to be true so ill be very obvious retrospect that future autonomous electric vehicles non-autonomous gasoline vehicles future will be like riding a horse using a foot bone its not that there are no horses yeah there are some horses but theyre unusual theyre niche so it just everythings going to be electric autonomous i think this like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that that future so a lot of automotive companies or most automotive companies have not internalized this which surprising because weve been shouting this from rooftops for such a long time it will accrue to their detriment future but all of our vehicles future will be autonomous yes so all vehicles that weve really made all 7 million vehicles vast majority are capable of autonomy were currently making on order of 35000 autonomous vehicles a week compare that to say waymos entire fleet less than - theyve have less than a 1000 cars we make 35000 a weeklars moravy yeah our cars look normalelon musk yeah they mostly look normal cybertruck looks abnormal cybercab/robotaxi we wanted to have something futuristic working i think it does look futuristic its worth noting with respect to cybercab its not its especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution vehicle manufacturing that also coming with cybercab cycle time like the units per hour of cybercab line it -- like this just really something special i mean this probably a yeah half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines like not same league what im saying not same league so its -- i said like several years ago that -- maybe most i mean hottest tesla product to copy will be factory just like buy a factorylars moravy yeah camera versus near a factory thats up to my --elon musk yeah its like things yeah so as we so were rapidly evolving manufacturing technology so anyway theres like basically i think having a regular $25000 model pointless yeah it would be silly like itll be completely at odds with what we believelars moravy autonomous world but matters as well as cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle thats what weve done with robotaxielon musk exactly autonomous it its fully considered cost per mile what matters if you try to make a car that essentially a hybrid manual automatic cars its not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yeah -- cybercab just not going to have steering wheels pads its only designed to optimize for autonomy but now itll cost on order of cost roughly $25000 so it a $25000 car you can -- you will be able to buy one on an exclusive exclusively if you want so just what happens to your mobile phones you dont need ittravis axelrod great thank you very much next question what tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centersunidentified company representative  so we aim on solving problems at source so at factory before they can even affect our customers we believe best service no service our heads dont even have themelon musk if car doesnt break yeah thats best thingunidentified company representative exactly dont see any with test you either do it remote yeah fix issue upstream or do it remotely do it through software maybe being at work or at home car can be parked weve addressed fixed issue weve partnered field with service to make sure were looking at same issues additionally just q3 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total at nearly 70 locations north america weve significantly expand size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon musk yeah i think its like actually a lot of merit to having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor okay you can start to approach yeah it should be more factory like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service people its way easier for somebody to come expert a few different types of repairs than every repairunidentified company representative  exactly this has helped us with base set these heavy repairs clogging up lane theyve dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through a bit massively treating it like a factoryelon musk yes this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got a good feedback with our carsunidentified company representative  exactly if you were with factory with service leaders together send back people from factories that field to factory to see it firsthand suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon musk yeah so i view this as a structural -- fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industryunidentified company representative also do a bunch of work on software side not only to automate diagnostics so identifying what needs to be done to a car before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car to be very efficiently worked on once it arrives so parts are there like lift scheduled technicians schedule like everything thats what im saying this whats wrong with me tells us tell service centerunidentified company representative  car everything ready vanelon musk yeah please fix me this whats wronguniden,0.142604,positive

erlutertdas j¬ngste infill-bohrprogramm der zone tesla sollte das vertrauen den gehalt und die kontinuitt verbessern und gleichzeitig wichtige daten f¬r potenzielle zuk¬nftige ressourcenschtzungen und mgliche betriebliche erweiterungsszenarien liefern (siehe pressemitteilung des unternehmens vom 15 juli 2024) beide bohrlcher durchschnitten das mineralisierte hauptziel gefolgt von dicken kupferreichen abschnitten mit zustzlichem goldgehalt was eine konsistente mineralisierung der gesamten zone besttigt und auf bereiche mit hheren kupfer-gold-gehalten hindeutet insbesondere das bohrloch ts-24-34 deckte eine neue kupfer-zink-mineralisierung unterhalb der aktuellen tesla-linsen auf diese neue mglichkeit unterstreicht die mglichkeit zustzlicher mineralisierter linsen was die wachstumsaussichten von tesla auf dem weg zu einer mglichen zuk¬nftigen ressourcenschtzung verbesserterin carswell vice president exploration bei foran kommentierte diesem sommer experimentierte unser explorationsteam mit neuen techniken die es uns ermglichten tesla zum ersten mal effektiv von der westseite her zu bohren was unsere abhngigkeit von eisbohrungen verringerte und uns einen aufregenden einblick das s¬dliche tesla-fugestein ermglichte den wir bisher noch nicht hatten wie bei der tesla-zone ¬blich gibt es immer wieder berraschungen bohrloch ts-24-34 wurde unter anderem eine neue mineralisierungslinse entdeckt die direkt unterhalb der tesla-hauptlinsen am s¬dlichen ende der zone liegt dar¬ber hinaus zeigen die beiden dieser pressemitteilung vorgestellten bohrlcher einmal mehr wie robust die hauptlinsen von tesla sein knnen da sie mehrere zonen mit hochgradigem kupfer und hochgradigem zink mit einer erfreulichen mchtigkeit der mineralisierung aufweisen die j¬ngsten

gebohrt sodass es die linsen umgekehrter stratigrafischer reihenfolge durchteufte ts-24-29 durchteufte die erwartete stratigraphie und mineralisierte horizonte die gut mit den umliegenden bohrlchern ¬bereinstimmen die ergebnisse von ts-24-29 stimmen auch gut mit den ergebnissen der zuvor verffentlichten ts-24-30 (etwa 200 m nordstlich gelegen) ¬berein die einen kombinierten 365-meter-abschnitt mit einer stringer-artigen mineralisierung aus der oberen kupferlinse ergab auf die direkt im bohrloch die haupt-massivsulfidlinse und eine dicke zone mit einer stringer-/brekzien-artigen kupfermineralisierung folgt (siehe pressemitteilung von foran vom 7 oktober 2024) ts-24-29 durchschnitt dasselbe mineralisierte paket doch an dieser stelle wurde die untere kupferlinse durch einen

abschnitts die 20 m lang war und einen gehalt von 076 % cu und 026 g/t au aufwies diese zone korreliert mit einer oberen kupferlinse die sich oberhalb der haupt-massivsulfidlinse befindet wie sie der zuvor verffentlichten ts-24-30 und einem groteil der tesla-zone zu sehen war direkt unterhalb der oberen kupferlinse wurde ein 24 m langer horizont aus massivem bis halbmassivem sulfid mit einem gehalt von 064 % cu 1364 % zn 371 g/t ag und 027 g/t au durchschnitten der vorwiegend aus massivem pyrit mit starkem feinkrnigem sphalerit der grundmasse und einer geringf¬gigen

dem s¬dlichen ende von tesla das bohrloch durchteufte erfolgreich die zone tesla unmittelbarer nhe der zone bridge dieses bohrloch durchteufte nicht nur die mineralisierten haupthorizonte von tesla und besttigte damit deren kontinuitt sondern durchteufte auch eine zustzliche mineralisierungszone im vergleich zu ts-24-29 die offenbar einen verkr¬mmten versatz und eine wiederholung der tesla-mineralisierung einem interpretierten unteren verwerfungsabschnitt darstellt der wahrscheinlich mit der faltung und verwerfung zusammenhngt die die tesla-zone ihre derzeitige position im verhltnis zur mcilvenna bay gebracht hat diese zustzliche mineralisierungszone wurde auch dem zuvor verffentlichten bohrloch ts-23-11w2 (siehe pressemitteilung von foran vom 25 mai 2023) durchteuft das eine hnliche zusammenhngende mineralisierungszone durchteufte die aus massivsulfid und einer stringerartigen mineralisierung etwa 350 m weiter neigungsabwrts besteht und einen gehalt von 193 % cu 178 % zn und 310 g/t ag auf 44 m aufweist (abbildung 6) diesem gebiet sind weitere bohrungen erforderlich um die ausdehnung dieses mineralisierten horizonts und die beziehung zwischen diesem verwerfungsabschnitt und tesla sowie der zone bridge zu definiereninsgesamt durchteufte ts-24-34 einen 68 m langen abschnitt des linsenfrmigen massivsulfids an der stratigrafischen spitze der tesla-zone das ¬berwiegend aus massivem pyrit mit geringem chalkopyrit und sphalerit einem stark chloritvernderten wirtsgestein besteht und einen gehalt von 162 % kupfer und 484 % zink aufweist direkt unterhalb des massivsulfids durchteufte das bohrloch eine zone mit starken brekzien und stringer-sulfiden ¬ber 84 m die eine bedeutende kupfer- und goldmineralisierung mit einem gehalt von 238 % kupfer und 189 g/t au enthielt dieser abschnitt spricht f¬r das potenzial das bei tesla besteht um weitere hochgradige kupfer-gold-abschnitte zu durchschneiden wenn die infill-bohrungen fortgesetzt werden auf diesen kupfer-gold-abschnitt folgte eine zweite breite zone mit einer ¬berwiegend stringerhnlichen mineralisierung auf 222 m die einen kupfergehalt von 130 % aufwies schlielich durchteufte ts-24-34 einen zustzlichen mineralisierten horizont der fuwand unterhalb von tesla diese fuwandmineralisierung befindet sich im allgemeinen stark blttrigen und rtlich brekzisen einheiten und weist

durchteufte nicht nur die mineralisierten haupthorizonte von tesla und besttigte damit deren kontinuitt sondern durchteufte auch eine zustzliche mineralisierungszone im vergleich zu ts-24-29 die offenbar einen verkr¬mmten versatz und eine wiederholung der tesla-mineralisierung einem interpretierten unteren verwerfungsabschnitt darstellt der wahrscheinlich mit der faltung und verwerfung zusammenhngt die die tesla-zone ihre derzeitige position im verhltnis zur mcilvenna bay gebracht hat diese zustzliche mineralisierungszone wurde auch dem zuvor verffentlichten bohrloch ts-23-11w2

die kontinuitt der zone teslaklicken sie hier um zu sehen wie erin carswell vp exploration von foran die neuesten ergebnisse erlutertdas j¬ngste infill-bohrprogramm der zone tesla sollte das vertrauen den gehalt und die kontinuitt verbessern und gleichzeitig wichtige daten f¬r potenzielle zuk¬nftige ressourcenschtzungen und mgliche betriebliche erweiterungsszenarien liefern (siehe pressemitteilung des unternehmens vom 15 juli 2024) beide bohrlcher durchschnitten das mineralisierte hauptziel gefolgt von dicken kupferreichen abschnitten mit zustzlichem goldgehalt was eine konsistente mineralisierung der gesamten zone besttigt und auf bereiche mit hheren kupfer-gold-gehalten hindeutet insbesondere das bohrloch ts-24-34 deckte eine neue kupfer-zink-mineralisierung unterhalb der

ressourcenschtzung verbesserterin carswell vice president exploration bei foran kommentierte diesem sommer experimentierte unser explorationsteam mit neuen techniken die es uns ermglichten tesla zum ersten mal effektiv von der westseite her zu bohren was unsere abhngigkeit von eisbohrungen verringerte und uns einen aufregenden einblick das s¬dliche tesla-fugestein ermglichte den wir bisher noch nicht hatten wie bei der tesla-zone ¬blich gibt es immer wieder berraschungen bohrloch ts-24-34 wurde unter anderem eine neue mineralisierungslinse entdeckt die direkt unterhalb der tesla-hauptlinsen am s¬dlichen ende der zone liegt dar¬ber hinaus zeigen die beiden dieser pressemitteilung vorgestellten bohrlcher einmal mehr wie robust die hauptlinsen von tesla sein knnen da sie mehrere zonen mit hochgradigem kupfer und hochgradigem zink mit einer erfreulichen mchtigkeit der mineralisierung aufweisen die j¬ngsten ergebnisse bei tesla unterstreichen die bemerkenswerte kontinuitt und erffnen

durchteufte die erwartete stratigraphie und mineralisierte horizonte die gut mit den umliegenden bohrlchern ¬bereinstimmen die ergebnisse von ts-24-29 stimmen auch gut mit den ergebnissen der zuvor verffentlichten ts-24-30 (etwa 200 m nordstlich gelegen) ¬berein die einen kombinierten 365-meter-abschnitt mit einer stringer-artigen mineralisierung aus der oberen kupferlinse ergab auf die direkt im bohrloch die haupt-massivsulfidlinse und eine dicke zone mit einer stringer-/brekzien-artigen kupfermineralisierung folgt (siehe pressemitteilung von foran vom 7 oktober 2024) ts-24-29 durchschnitt

bestehenden bohrlchern einem gebiet mit begrenzten bohrungen nahe dem s¬dlichen ende von tesla das bohrloch durchteufte erfolgreich die zone tesla unmittelbarer nhe der zone bridge dieses bohrloch durchteufte nicht nur die mineralisierten haupthorizonte von tesla und besttigte damit deren kontinuitt sondern durchteufte auch eine zustzliche mineralisierungszone im vergleich zu ts-24-29 die offenbar einen verkr¬mmten versatz und eine wiederholung der tesla-mineralisierung einem interpretierten unteren verwerfungsabschnitt darstellt der wahrscheinlich mit der faltung und verwerfung zusammenhngt die die tesla-zone ihre derzeitige position im verhltnis zur mcilvenna bay gebracht hat diese zustzliche mineralisierungszone wurde auch dem zuvor verffentlichten bohrloch ts-23-11w2 (siehe pressemitteilung von foran vom 25 mai 2023) durchteuft das eine hnliche zusammenhngende mineralisierungszone durchteufte die aus massivsulfid und einer stringerartigen mineralisierung etwa 350

mineralisierten horizonts und die beziehung zwischen diesem verwerfungsabschnitt und tesla sowie der zone bridge zu definiereninsgesamt durchteufte ts-24-34 einen 68 m langen abschnitt des linsenfrmigen massivsulfids an der stratigrafischen spitze der tesla-zone das ¬berwiegend aus massivem pyrit mit geringem chalkopyrit und sphalerit einem stark chloritvernderten wirtsgestein besteht

123,2024-11-14,tesla cybercab worlds first ai-driven robotaxi,11 teslas ai-driven autonomous cybercab to replace human cab driverselon musk one of most powerful individuals world who responsible for 21st-century technological revolution he has redefined human understanding of technology its applications various fields contribution of elon musk his companies like tesla starlink space x technological advancements of our contemporary world notable revolutionaryeach company harvesting success their respective fields tesla has launched an ai-driven cyber cab starlink on verge of expanding its broadband service to india space x has successfully caught a rocket booster as it returned to earth from these details we can conclude that musks companies are top-tier performers their respective fieldstesla always known for its enhanced technology applications innovations latest innovation from company an ai-driven robotaxi named cybercab this article we focus on comprehensive details of cybercab what it can do our contemporary worldthe name tesla not a novel one to people around world we all have seen immense growth of tesla recent years tesla cybercab latest building block tesla empire tesla aiming to build a society with fully automated driverless cars through their robotaxi musk claimed that driverless autonomous ai-driven vehicles could be safer cheaper than vehicles controlled by human beings let us take a look at complete breakdown of tesla cyber cab details this segmentthe unveiling of tesla cybercab was on october 10th 2024 event took place at hollywood studios official unveiling event named we robot was crowded tech enthusiasts were mesmerized by design features of teslas cybercab project still its early stages we can expect official initiation of production of robotaxi 2026 rumors are spreading that we may need to wait till 2027 to see fully-fledged production of cybercab but company has claimed that vehicle will become available before 2027the cybercab developed by tesla a two-seated ai-driven fully automatic vehicle that has a futuristic design design of robotaxi most attractive feature segment it has a classy futuristic design robotaxi has two gullwing doors that can be opened upwards this design can bring vehicle a futuristic high-tech aesthetic premium look tesla has worked on aerodynamic shape of robotaxi which can get a better outlook on totality of designthe wheels of cybercab follow minimalist disc-like tires without spokes this could enhance futuristic look of cyber can create conditioned images of futuristic cars minds of buyers tesla implemented futuristic design their ai-driven cybercab made no compromises its designthe ai-driven cybercab of tesla has no steering wheels pedals vehicle fully automated controlled by ai using cameras placed car surrounding cameras sensors of robotaxi give input to cybercab it monitors analyses surroundings by using this input speed range of cybercab can go up to 200 miles tesla may use inductive charging their newly introduced cybercabs this charging technology similar to wireless charging tesla exploring possibilities of implementing this technology their electric vehicles(ev)elon musk who ceo of tesla has unveiled that price of their ai-driven cybercab will only cost less than or equal to 30000 us dollars this price range makes it one of cheapest self-driving cars world price range of tesla cybercab could be arguable a sophisticated futuristic autonomic car getting for less than 30000 us dollars will raise questions about safety measurements accuracy of technological adaptationstesla claimed that production of cybercab full swing they are planning to initiate production process before 2027 experts from industry believe that tesla may not be able to start their production within disclosed period delay could happen because of technological hazards regulatory compliances if company can meet adequate regulatory instructions compliances along with advanced technology adaptations as previously planned then production of cybercab can start from previously planned date itself official release date of tesla cybercab not available but we can expect a sooner release if production process initiated as plannedthese are available features of tesla cybercab at moment tesla planning to introduce something big that has enough potential to redefine our transportation system road culture but people are concerned about safety reliability of these kinds of products gaining trust of people will be hardest task for tesla successful integration of its automated cybercabs into our societythe tesla cybercab a novel vehicle our modern society main feature of this vehicle that it doesnt need a separate driver or individual to function vehicle will be an ai-driven self-driving cab basic technology used production of cybercab full self-driving(fsd) software smart summon full self-driving software a semi-autonomous driving assistant technology used tesla cars tesla cars can automatically change lanes self-park respond to traffic signals slow down stop maintain speed by using full self driving smart summon another underlying technology tesla cars it feature that allows user to call or summon their tesla car out of parking space using tesla mobile applicationtesla cybercab uses both these technologies for its proper functioning cybercab will automatically drive follow road instructions by using fsd users can call cab using smart summon technology this integrated technology responsible factor for successful operation of tesla cybercabs without human intervention integrated cameras cybercab will detect surroundings react according to surroundingsthe concept of autonomous cars exciting to hear tempting to try however major issue regarding automated self-driving cars safety concerns we dont know if people are confident enough to rely on these services daily same concern important factor that tesla needs to take care ofautonomous car developers use lidar( light detection ranging) technology to train develop products lidar can detect analyze surroundings by creating digital three-dimensional images of surroundings of a vehicle however tesla using digital cameras instead of lidar to train their artificial intelligence systemthis initiative from tesla has created enough problems already four collisions a fatal crash are reported tesla under investigation by us governments road safety agency for above-mentioned four collisions a fatal crash these incidents will question technological brilliance successful implementation of technology their self-driving automated vehiclestesla needs to take these safety measurements security concerns seriously to gain a large number of users once cybercab released they need to ensure that artificial intelligence system strong enough to fight against all possible hacking building trust peoples minds only thing to do for success of teslas cybercabautonomous vehicle space a major arena 21st century tesla has some serious competitors this field to supersede waymo amazons zoox general motors cruise are major competitors of tesla autonomous vehicle space they are all using same technology as tesla to build their concept vehicles but tesla shows an upper hand this arena since it has unlimited resources unmatched access to autonomous vehicle technology however other companies are putting a lot of pressure on tesla pushing them for further advancement sphere manufacturers of automated vehicles are deploying these kinds of vehicles on a lower scale this because of regulatory issues safety compliances put forward by road safety departmentelon musk well known for his futuristic vision technological implementation tesla space x had to face so many developmental challenges their early phases but musk was a determined personality who never accepted failure as an option cybercab one of latest futuristic innovations of elon musks teslait still its early stages production has not been initiated yet because of regulatory compliances unveiling event created enough talk community about upcoming cybercab company planning to start its production before 2027 so elon musk up to something big revolutionize transportation system cybercab a concept that has enough potential to redefine our future transportation method world shifting its focus to ai features their applications so an ai-driven automated vehicle will not only remain as a conceptelon musk will not back off from his initiatives until it gets its ultimate success scenario of cybercab will not be an exception concept needs to be successfully implemented made available to public this has to be done after vehicle meets all necessary safety requirements regulatory compliancesthe ceo of tesla elon musk pronounced cybercab unveiling event that self-driving cars or autonomous cars will be 20 to 30 times safer more secure than human-controlled vehicles we could see a more advanced mode of transportation future where autonomous cars play a key role our transportation facility but a complete eradication of traditional vehicles not on board but transportation facilities types of vehicles we use it will undergo significant change as time progressesautonomous vehicles might play role of an alternative to traditional vehicles but a complementary service of both traditional autonomous vehicles will be idealthere no actual answer available to this question it can be possible impossible it will make a significant buzz mode of transportation our way of perceiving travel management system a road driving system with complete eradication of human intervention miles far away all automated cars are still their budding phase vehicles have to meet required security standards regulatory compliances to get permission to initiate their production so a complete obliteration of human intervention from this space not likely to happen shortly however a significant impact will be there after implementation of automated cabs carsthe cybercab unveiling event has given enough hope to our society about a futuristic prototype that can work without human intervention cybercab a futuristic concept it has maintained that futuristic feel its every aspect tesla aiming to provide a driverless fully automated vehicle that doesnt have steerings pedals via cybercab tesla uses full self-driving(fsd) software smart summon technology for successful functioning of robotaxi along with this technology it uses artificial intelligence services cameras for navigation control automated drivingthis article conveys all latest information on tesla cybercab consider read this article as a comprehensive guide to know more about teslas cybercab project production of cybercab will most likely begin before 2027 if it successfully follows all regulatory instructions tesla planning to make this product available for a price of less than 30000 us dollars this factor will also attract a lot of people into business we all need to wait for further updates from tesla to speak more authentically,0.162249,positive
124,2024-10-27,10 things tesla owners keep quiet about,theres no denying that tesla sits at very top of ev throne us market it benefits from a strong market share some international regions as well while making an equally impressive mark china where more established domestic brands like byd continue to dominate fact tesla only brand that truly taking fight to chinese ev makers who many believe to be a threat to global market tesla one of oldest ev-only brands existence today which means it benefits from more experience time to build a solid reputation remove adswhile brand has enjoyed abundant success over years its current line of products not entirely problem-free tesla owners are well-known to defend their favorite brand to death but there are some factors that arent often discussed of course we have to specify that every brand comes with its fair share of problems that this feature merely aims to disclose some factors you may want to be aware of before considering a tesla ev ownership experiencein order to give you most up-to-date accurate information possible data used to compile this article was sourced from teslas websites other authoritative sources car driver epa cox automotiverelated tesla could be legal hot water over robotaxi eventa new lawsuit over ai images their similarity to bladerunner screenshots could create issues for tesla1 teslas has known quality issues  remove adstesla has opted for a very simple minimalist design consisting of fewer parts both inside out benefit of this that they are much cheaper to manufacture however this has resulted some concerning quality control issues many owners have documented evidence of poor panel construction with inconsistent gaps fitments throughout exteriorsome of most concerning issues have been experienced within cabin where owners have noted problems with bubbling mold from vegan leather interior panels fittings trimmings also struggle with poor fitments that detach degrade even after moderate use teslas also tend to struggle with technical glitches but thankfully these are resolved via convenient over-the-air updates we do have to point out that newer tesla models are substantially better than those produced half a decade ago thanks to brands strategy of timely integrating upgrades to its entire catalog remove ads 2 full self-driving isnt completely autonomousdespite tesla calling its advanced driver assist system full self-driving system still requires a level of human intervention even so system has come under fire previous years for many inconsistencies that have resulted some collisions accidents very few of which have resulted fatalities this largely because users dont completely understand technology place too much faith it remove adsfsd remains one of better adas systems available today justifying its exorbitant $8000 price tag tesla includes very clear disclaimers regarding it not being a fully autonomous system this isnt really a fault on teslas part but it remains a problem that owners dont discuss frequently enough fsd now available on all derivatives including model 3 model y cybertruck3 teslas plaid 0-60 mph times arent completely honesttesla claims that model s plaid can cover a 0-60 mph sprint 199 seconds but fine print states that it subtracts a one-foot rollout to be fair lucid does same thing with its sapphires 189-second claimed time subtracting first foot a standard procedure when drag racing but it doesnt reflect models real-world abilities from a standing start remove ads tesla plaid

time under very specific conditions this includes preconditioning powertrain ensuring that battery has sufficient charge waiting 15 minutes between each launch event these are very strict conditions that some of brands rivals dont struggle with but it best interest of protecting drivetrain system long runrelated heres when tesla cybertrucks range extender will be availabletesla has delayed its production again4 teslas arent repair-friendlymechanically speaking teslas can easily be repaired by trained accredited professionals but when it comes to exterior repairs to body panels things start to get very complicated a bit annoying this goes back to teslas decision to use lighter cheaper materials production methods which includes its gigacasting process remove adsthe use of aluminum gigacasting means that you cannot beat some of exterior panels rendering your tesla irreparable some extreme cases tesla does offer approved body repair support that ensures functionality safety longevity of your tesla but you need to be prepared for some of most expensive quotes that youve ever seen your life this because you have to completely replace panels with new factory parts5 teslas epa range estimates are hard to achieveteslas benefit from some of best epa-estimated range efficiency figures but many reviewers note that these results are very difficult to achieve real-world

that contribute to this evs remain uncharted territory for a lot of consumers so theyre hesitant to consider used options theyre also somewhat impractical if you plan to cover long distances as national charging infrastructure still requires comprehensive developments teslas drastic price cuts recent years have also affected previous model year used valuesrelated you cant buy a new tesla model 3 for less than $40000 anymorethe cheapest model 3 now costs over $40000 you have chinas battery technology to blame however its replacement offers a lot of value7 teslas are not as affordable anymorewith recent introduction of tesla model 3 highlandupdate removal of model y rear-wheel drives standard battery pack you can no longer purchase a tesla for under $40000 when considering inflation over last decade new tesla models are relatively more affordable than their predecessors but current financial climate they have to be considered more premium options remove ads how inflation reduction act works inflation reduction act offers up to $7500 tax rebates for new electric vehicle purchases to qualify evs must meet specific criteria including north american assembly use of critical minerals from us trade partners tax credit applies only to vehicles priced below $55000 for cars $80000 for suvs trucks vans income caps apply; individuals earning more than $150000 or couples earning more than $300000 do not qualify a separate rebate of up to $4000 available for used evs priced below $25000 law also incentivizes automakers to establish domestic supply chains for ev components like batteriesthankfully most tesla models benefit from three $7500 inflation reduction act tax rebate which makes them much cheaper alternatives to their main rivals this thanks to teslas decision to keep bulk of its production supply chain within us ira rebate only applies to specific tesla models upcoming cybercab said to be an affordable option one that will be available for sale (not just a robotaxi essentially) but it still some time away remove ads 8 tesla supercharging network gets congestedtesla benefits from one of most comprehensive public charging networks us dc level three supercharger a noteworthy drawing card for a lot of potential tesla owners that plan to cover extensive distances away from home problem that a lot of tesla owners are facing today however that they are constantly being subjected to long queues at key public charging stationsin recent years tesla has been gradually opening its supercharger network to ev users from other brands albeit at a higher premium this results you having to wait even longer for a full recharge being subjected to higher rates as network increases prices during heavy usage this a noteworthy problem during festive seasons when youre more likely to be traveling remove ads 9 teslas rivals are catching up closetesla enjoys a substantial market share over domestic ev market thanks to some core strategic decisions but rise of new ev start-ups heavy investments from more established manufacturers has affected this brands like rivian ford are showing that local consumers value diversity as products like r1s

remove adsthese brands still have a long way to go until they make a noticeable impact on teslas success but way things are going we are more likely to see teslas market share decline as time passes brand may counter this with a cheaper model 2 alternative but we are yet to see any evidence of such a product being introduced to market despite rumors suggesting itll arrive 2026related heres why you should wait for tesla model y juniperthe juniper update a long way away but there are a lot of reasons as to why this model y update may be worth wait1 10 elon musks statements may enrage some fanswhile there are many people who adore elon musk his tendency to freely say whatever on his mind there are others who express great concern distaste theres evidence to suggest that this has impacted brands quarterly sales figures resulting a relatively unstable stock performance remove adsdespite this musk sticks by his guns continues to express his conservative sometimes controversial

wichtige daten f¬r potenzielle zuk¬nftige ressourcenschtzungen und mgliche betriebliche erweiterungsszenarien liefern (siehe pressemitteilung des unternehmens vom 15 juli 2024) beide bohrlcher durchschnitten das mineralisierte hauptziel gefolgt von dicken kupferreichen abschnitten mit zustzlichem goldgehalt was eine konsistente mineralisierung der gesamten zone besttigt und auf bereiche mit hheren kupfer-gold-gehalten hindeutet insbesondere das bohrloch ts-24-34 deckte eine neue kupfer-zink-mineralisierung unterhalb der aktuellen tesla-linsen auf diese neue mglichkeit unterstreicht die mglichkeit zustzlicher mineralisierter linsen was die wachstumsaussichten von tesla auf dem weg zu einer mglichen zuk¬nftigen ressourcenschtzung verbesserterin carswell vice president exploration bei foran kommentierte diesem sommer experimentierte unser explorationsteam mit neuen techniken die es uns ermglichten tesla zum ersten mal effektiv von der westseite her zu bohren was unsere abhngigkeit von eisbohrungen verringerte und uns einen aufregenden einblick das s¬dliche tesla-fugestein ermglichte den wir bisher noch nicht hatten wie bei der tesla-zone ¬blich gibt es immer wieder berraschungen bohrloch ts-24-34 wurde unter anderem eine neue mineralisierungslinse entdeckt die direkt unterhalb der tesla-hauptlinsen am s¬dlichen ende der zone liegt dar¬ber hinaus zeigen die beiden dieser pressemitteilung vorgestellten bohrlcher einmal mehr wie robust die hauptlinsen von tesla sein knnen da sie mehrere zonen mit hochgradigem kupfer und hochgradigem zink mit einer erfreulichen mchtigkeit der mineralisierung aufweisen die j¬ngsten ergebnisse bei tesla unterstreichen die bemerkenswerte kontinuitt und erffnen mglichkeiten f¬r eine zuk¬nftige wertschpfung f¬r

hauptst¬tzen aus durchgef¬hrt die sich im s¬dlichen teil der zone tesla befinden um grere l¬cken den aktuellen bohrlochabstnden zu schlieen und die kontinuitt und den tenor von tesla zu besttigen die bohrlcher wurden auf dem land auf einer streichenlnge von etwa 300 m der zone niedergebracht und von der fuseite aus unter verwendung von richtungsbohrungen gebohrt um senkrechte abschnitte den mineralisierten horizonten zu erhalten im rahmen des programms sommer-herbst 2024 wurden insgesamt sieben tesla-pierce-punkte erzieltin dieser pressemitteilung werden die ergebnisse von zwei

dem s¬dlichen ende von tesla das bohrloch durchteufte erfolgreich die zone tesla unmittelbarer nhe der zone bridge dieses bohrloch durchteufte nicht nur die mineralisierten haupthorizonte von tesla und besttigte damit deren kontinuitt sondern durchteufte auch eine zustzliche mineralisierungszone im vergleich zu ts-24-29 die offenbar einen verkr¬mmten versatz und eine wiederholung der tesla-mineralisierung einem interpretierten unteren verwerfungsabschnitt darstellt der wahrscheinlich mit der faltung und verwerfung zusammenhngt die die tesla-zone ihre derzeitige position im verhltnis zur mcilvenna bay gebracht hat diese zustzliche mineralisierungszone wurde auch dem zuvor verffentlichten bohrloch ts-23-11w2 (siehe pressemitteilung von foran vom 25 mai 2023) durchteuft

teslas revenue grew 8% its net income increased to $217 billion10/21/2024investors are eagerly awaiting teslas earnings report scheduled for wednesday addition to stats investors are eager to learn more about companys strategic plans including how tesla intends to maintain or increase sales of existing ev models as they age companys progress developing ai robotics technology teslas strategies for regulatory hurdles10/18/2024the us auto safety regulator investigating teslas full self-driving software after four reported collisions including one fatal crash national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) evaluating whether software poses an unreasonable risk to safety could potentially recall vehiclestesla unveiled its new robotaxi cybercab at its we robot event last week however investors are not impressed as ceo elon musk has continually failed to meet his own deadlines addition they are concerned about technology cost of producing cybercab following event musks net worth decreased by $15 billion10/14/2024teslas we robot event failed to impress last week while it showcased teslas cybercab as expected it did not address several key areas that investors were looking for including progress of teslas full self-driving technology (fsd) economics of its ride-sharing service its go-to-market strategy morgan stanley has maintained an overweight rating on teslas stock but has lowered its price target to $31010/10/2024teslas we robot event premieres this evening at warner bros studio lot despite initial market uncertainty prior to event teslas shares have

recommendation24/7 wall streets 12-month tesla price projection $21320 which would be a (-1878%) loss mixed opinions likely stem from unconventional way that musk runs not only tesla but all of his companies fears over potential for a domino effect if negative events impact one to cause a spillover effect due to his mercurial temperament are not unfoundedthe latter part of 2024 2025 looks to be an exciting period for teslathe much ballyhooed robotaxi unveiling has been bumped to october 2024 (although this can wind up even later 2024 or early 2025 as musk notorious for missing date targets) additionally teslas fsd version 125 will also make its debut order to prime pump to improve acceptability for its autonomous vehicles tesla management has already cut price of fsd (supervised) north america has launched free trials for interested partiesadditionally tesla management gave guidance its july earnings report that vehicle volume growth rate 2024 may be notably lower than growth rate last year ev giant added that growth its energy storage business driven by buzz over its new 4680 battery cell which improves vehicle range lowers costs should outpace its automotive segment that trend will likely reverse balance out 2025tesla also looking to become a major player other parts of world it will have to compete with firms like nissan ford general motors vw toyota nio xpeng to either become leaders or stay at top of ev market these areas teslas shanghai berlin gigafactories were built 2018 2019 to circumvent tariffs other import obstacles china europeit appears that musks vision for mass production automation has become a reality china where shanghai gigafactory automation reportedly up to 95% berlin gigafactory building both tesla model-y evs batteries at this time two factories should be both at full capacity by 2026 ev output should allow tesla to avoid chinese european tariffs as well as create enough surplus inventory for export to other countries fact eus tariff on chinese evs has a discount for chinese-made model y imports teslas berlin factory facing some regional friction over factorys effect on environment with reports of heavy deforestation water pollution tesla will likely need to rectify matters with german government before it can ramp up to match china gigafactorys projections assuming that these issues are resolved 2026 expected to see tesla take a jump to $26420 a 064% gain2027robotics development became an obvious decision as mass production ramped up although teslas experience was not without its own minefields one new creation from its robotics work was tesla bot dubbed optimus musks enthusiasm for potential of optimus enormous he stated q2 2024 report some of following commentsi think long-term value of optimus will exceed that of everything else that tesla combinedi suspect that long-term demand for general-purpose humanoid robots excess of 20 billion units tesla -- that has most advanced humanoid robot world also very good at manufacturing which these other companies are notmy rough estimate long-term market cap on order of $5 trillion for -- maybe more for autonomous transport its several times that number for general purpose humanoid robotsits a wild -- very wild future were heading forthe projected commercialization launch of optimus will likely be 1 of 2 major breakthroughs for tesla 2027 other will be a push towards an official full-scale robotaxi production distribution ark invests cathie woods believes it will start 2025 but regulatory obstacles will likely not allow it to fully launch until 2027 as a result eps expected to jump almost 50% a projected price of $39360 would be a +129 point gain2028-29cathie woods also predicted that as much as 90% of teslas enterprise value earnings will be attributed to robotaxi business by 2028-29 this prediction may anticipate a possibility of uber lyft becoming clients or partners rather than rivals musks supercharger network crucial to success of a robotaxi industry us since secretary of transportation pete buttiigieg has basically spent over $1 billion each on just (7) dot-built recharging stations to date this a huge strategic leverage that

ballyhooed robotaxi unveiling has been bumped to october 2024 (although this can wind up even later 2024 or early 2025 as musk notorious for missing date targets) additionally teslas fsd version 125

its energy storage business driven by buzz over its new 4680 battery cell which improves vehicle range lowers costs should outpace its automotive segment that trend will likely reverse balance out

combinedi suspect that long-term demand for general-purpose humanoid robots excess of 20 billion units tesla -- that has most advanced humanoid robot world also very good at manufacturing which these other companies are notmy rough estimate long-term market cap on order of $5 trillion for -- maybe more for autonomous transport its several times that number for general purpose humanoid robotsits a wild -- very wild future were heading forthe projected commercialization launch of optimus will likely be 1 of 2 major breakthroughs for tesla 2027 other will be a push towards an official full-scale robotaxi production distribution ark invests cathie woods believes it will start 2025 but regulatory obstacles will likely not allow it to fully launch until 2027 as a result eps expected to jump almost 50% a projected price of $39360 would be a +129 point gain2028-29cathie woods also predicted that as much as 90% of teslas enterprise value earnings will be attributed to robotaxi business by

134,2024-10-24,tesla (tsla) q3 2024 earnings call transcript,good afternoon everyone welcome to teslas third quarter 2024 q&a webcast my name travis axelrod head of investor relations im joined today by elon musk vaibhav taneja a number of other executives our q3 results were announced at about 300 pm central time update deck we published at same link as webcastduring this call we will discuss our business outlook make forward-looking statements these comments are based on our predictions expectations as of today actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks uncertainties including those mentioned our most recent filings with sec during question-and-answer portion of todays call please limit yourself to one question one follow-upthe motley fool stock advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are 10 best stocks for investors to buy now tesla wasnt one of them 10 stocks that made cut could produce monster returns coming yearsconsider when nvidia made this list on april 15 2005 if you invested $1000 at time of our recommendation youd have $879935*stock advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success including guidance on building a portfolio regular updates from analysts two new stock picks each month stock advisor service has more than quadrupled return of s&p 500 since 2002*[operator instructions] before we jump into q&a elon has some opening remarks elonelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectthank you so to recap as someone was saying something that what -- industry was seeing year-over-year declines order volumes q3 tesla at same time has achieved record deliveries fact i think if you look at ev companies worldwide to best of my knowledge no ev company even profitableand im not -- to best of my knowledge there was no ev division of any company of any existing car company that profitable so it notable that tesla profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment this quarter actually a record q3 for us so we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday so congratulations to teams that made it happen tesla thats staggering immense amount of work to make 7 million carsso you see we all have -- energy storage business growing like wildfire with strong demand for both megapack powerwall as you all know on october 10 we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that i think very compelling that tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience future where you have humanoid robots working among craft not with a canned video a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks whatnot we had 50 autonomous vehicles there were 20 cybercabs but there were an additional 30 model ys operating fully autonomously entire night carrying thousands of people with no incidents entire nightand all those who went there that worth emphasizing that cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to whole night went very smoothly so regarding vehicle business we are still on track to deliver our affordable models starting first half of 2025 this -- i think probably people want should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year at risk of -- to take a bit of risk here i do want to give some rough estimate which i think its 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year notwithstanding negative external events like if theres some force majeure events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like thatwe cant overcome massive force majeure events but i think with our lower-cost vehicles with advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year my best guess then cybercab reaching volume production 26 i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 just starting production reaching volume production 26and that should be substantial but were aiming for at least 2 million units a year of cybercab that will be more than one factory but i think its at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimately so yes these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses those are my best guesses cell 4680 lines team actually doing great work therethe 4680 rapidly approaching point where it most competitive cell so when you consider fully landed -- cost of a battery pack fully landed us net of incentives duties 4680 tracking to be most competitive maybe lower cost per kilowatt hour fully considered than any other alternative which -- were not quite there yet but were close to being there which i think extremely exciting weve got several -- a lot of ideas to go well beyond that so i think theres -- if we execute well 4680 -- well have -- tesla internally produced cell will be most cost competitive cell north america a testament to tremendous amount of hard work there done by teamso thats to say well continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors i tend not to provide -- to make cells just internally so i dont want to sort of here were obviously increasing substantially our vehicle output our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cellsand most of them will still come from suppliers but i think it some good news that tesla internal cell likely to be most competitive us so with respect to autonomy as people are experiencing cars really from week to week there are significant improvements miles between interventions so with new version 125 release of full self-driving cybertruck combining code into a single stack so that city driving engine highway driving are one stack which a big improvement for highway drivingso its just all neural nets release of actually smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here were also -- so thats 125 version 13 of fsd going out soonwill elaborate more on that later call we expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement miles between interventions compared to 125 actually looking at year as whole improvement miles interventions we think will be at least three orders of magnitude so thats a very dramatic improvement course of year we expect that trend to continue next yearso current total expectation internal expectation for tesla fsd having longer miles between versions than human second quarter of next year which means it may end up being third quarter but its next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year ashok do you want to say anythingashok elluswamy -- director autopilot softwareyeah miles between critical interventions like you mentioned elon we already made 100x improvement with 125 from starting of this year then with v13 release we expect to be 1000x from beginning from january of this year on production software this came because of technology improvements going to end to end having higher frame rate partly also helped by hardware force more capabilities so onand we hope that we continue to scale neural network data training compute etc by q2 next year we should cross over average even miles per critical intervention collision that caseelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architecti mean that just unvarnished our internal estimateso thats not sandbagging or anything else our internal estimate q2 of next year to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter a vast majority of humanity has no idea that tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a model 3 or model y it looks like a normal car so you dont expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itselfa cybercab looks different a cybertruck looks different but model y model 3 are -- look theyre good-looking cars but look fairly normal you dont expect a fairly normal-looking car to have intelligence enough ai to be able to drive itself but it does so we do want to expose that to more people so were doing -- every time we have a significant improvement software well roll out another sort of 30-day trial to encourage people to try it againand we are seeing a significant improvement adoption so take rate for fsd has improved substantially especially after 10/10 event yes so theres no need to wait for robotaxi or cybercab to experience full autonomywe expect to achieve that next year with -- with our existing vehicle lineashok elluswamy -- director autopilot softwarei wanted to actually spot someone gives a small taste of what its going to look like car able to drive itself to user within private parking lots currently its speed-limited but then its going to quickly be increased we already had more than 1 billion usage terms of smart summonelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectye we actually -- we have for tesla employees bay area we already are offering ride-hailing capabilities so you can actually -- with development app you can request a ride it will take you anywhere bay areawe do have a safety driver for now but its not required to do that weve developed -- i mean david do you want to elaborate on thatdavid lau -- vice president software engineeringyeah sure its david we showed some screenshots of this q1 shareholder deck this real weve been testing it for good part of yearand building blocks that we needed order to build this functionality deliver it to production weve been thinking about working on for years it just so happens that weve used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers meantime such as sharing your profile synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into whether its another car that you own or a car that somebody has loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into it looks exactly like yours everything synchronized seat mirror positions media navigation everything same just what you would expect from one of our robotaxis but we gave that functionality to our customers right now because weve built it intending for it to be used future but were releasing that functionality nowall end-to-end cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality sending a navigation destination from your phone to vehicle so were doing that now with ride-hailing app but its something that weve made available to customers for years seeing progress on a route mobile app thats something youll need for ride-hailing app but again we released it meantime so its not like were just starting to think about this stuff right now while were building out early stages of our ride-hailing networkweve been thinking about this for quite a long time were excited to get functionality out thereelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectand we do expect to roll out ride-hailing california texas next year to public now california somewhere -- theres quite a long regulatory approval process i think we should get approval next year but its contingent upon regulatory approval texas a lot faster so its -- well definitely have available texas probably have it available california subject to regulatory approvaland then -- maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least california texas so i think that would be very exciting thats really a profound change tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle a battery manufacturing company at that pointso we published q3 vehicle safety report which shows one crash for every 7 million miles of autopilot that compares to us average of one crash roughly every 700000 miles so its currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to usaverage we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate needs of both fsd optimus we are currently not training compute-constrained probably biggest limiting factor of fsd actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakesand when you start getting to where it can take 10000 miles to find a mistake it takes a while to actually figure out which it is software a better than software b it actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them makes mistakes -- would take a long time to make mistakes so its actually single biggest limiting factor how long does it take us to figure out which version better sort of a high-class problem obviously having a drone fleet very helpful for breaking this outand then with optimus we showed a massive improvement optimus dexterity improvement on october 10 our next-gen hand forearm which 22 degrees of freedom which double prior hand or forearm its extremely human-like so its much better at tactile sensing its really -- i feel confident saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot were moreover only company that really has all of ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robotsbecause things that -- what other companies are missing that theyre missing ai brain that theyre missing people to really scale to very high-volume production so you see some impressive video demos but what like localized ai volume to very high numbers as ive said on a few occasions before i think optimus will ultimately be most valuable part so i think has a good chance of being most viable product that we made for energy business thats doing extremely welland opportunity ahead gigantic lathrop megapack factory reached 200 megapacks a week which now a 40-gigawatt hour a year run rate we have a second factory shanghai that will begin with 20-gigawatt hour a year run rate q1 next year so next quarter that will also scale outit wont be long before were shipping 100-gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at tesla will that -- i mean that will ultimately grow i think to multiple terawatt hours per year it has to actually order to have a sustainable energy future if youre not at terawatt scale youre not really moving needleso if you look at our very complicated last master plan which i think actually too much detail ill maybe ask to analyze it give us tldr on management plan we shared that master plan that it possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation batteries electric transport there were no fundamental material limitations like theres not some very rare material that we dont have enough of we actually have enough with raw materials to take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable dramatically increased its trust usage would still be fully sustainableone way to think of progress of a civilization this may sound a little esoteric but percentage completion of scale so [inaudible] scale one would be youre using all power of a planet were currently less than 1% on level 1 level 2 would be using all power of sun level 3 all of power of galaxy so weve got a long way to go long way to gowhen you think of courtship terms it becomes obvious that by far biggest source of energy sun everything else so conclusion tesla focused on building future of energy transport robotics ai this a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trendswe think what were doing right approach if we execute on our objectives i think we will my prediction tesla will become most valuable company world probably by a long shot i want to thank tesla team once again for strong execution a tough operating environment were looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future thank youtravis axelrod -- head of investor relationsgreat thank you very much elon vaibhav has some opening remarks as wellvaibhav taneja -- chief financial officerthanks our q3 results were positive once again demonstrate scale to which business has evolved or with generation of record operating cash flows of $63 billion our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter year on year while we had unit volume growth we did experience a reduction asps primarily due to impact of financing incentivesas a reminder we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks financial institutions recognize cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue we released fsd for cybertruck other features like actually smart summon like elon talked about north america which contributed $326 million of revenues quarter we continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year to expand on this at an industry level china continues to outperform usand europe by a factor of three if there something to be learned from that this gives a signal of what to come other regions as customers acceptance of ev growth we feel that right strategy to build affordable more compelling leads our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventoryto support this strategy were continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options when you compare any vehicle our lineup with other oems we believe our vehicles provide much better value particularly when you consider safety features performance unparalleled software functionalities like david also talked about include also what ashok had talked about around autonomy music options parental controls much more while every vehicle our lineup comes up with these capabilities there an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners we plan on making these more visible our interactions with both existing future customers automotive margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of a feature release discussed beforeincrease our overall production delivery volume benefit from marketing pricing more localized deliveries region which resulted lower freight duties sustaining these margins q4 however will be challenging given current economic environment note that we are focused on cost per vehicle there are numerous work streams within company to squeeze out cost without compromising on customer experienceelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah im assuming thats a helpful -- hopefully a helpful macro trend if theres a decline interest rates this has a massive effect on automotive demand because vast majority of people -- demand driven by monthly payment can they afford monthly payment so most likely well see continued decline interest rates which helps with affordability of vehiclesvaibhav taneja -- chief financial officeryeah i mean that one trend which we observed industry thats because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates people are holding on to their cars longer especially us that actually having an impact on overall industry tooas we discussed earlier as we discussed back orders energy deployments fluctuate quarter on quarter due to customer readiness location of orders being fulfilled not necessarily an indicator of demand of production within quarter while we did see a decline q3 we expect to grow deployment sequentially q4 to end year with more than double of last year energy margins q3 were a record at more than 30% this a function of mix of projects being deployed quarternote that there will be fluctuation margins as we manage through deployments our inventory our pipeline backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots we are doing our best to keep up with demand just coming back on automotive margins i talked about -- sorry i talked about what happeningone other thing which i want to also share that were seeing -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to like i said before about squeezing of cost but this something which we also are very capable of i mean just q3 we faced our lowest cost per vehicle that a trend which we want to keep focused on then going on to service otherwe continue to show improvements q3 this was a result of better performance both our service as well as it includes collision part sales merchandise continued growth supercharging these fee-based revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter on year-on-year basisthis partially due to restructuring we undertook q2 cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase costs related to our ai efforts weve started using gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead of schedule are on track to get 50000 gpus deployed texas by end of this month one thing which id like to elaborate that were being really judicious on our ai compute spend to saying how best we can utilize existing infrastructure before making further investmentson capex front we had about $35 billion quarter this was a sequential increase largely because of investments ai compute we now expect our capex for year to be excess of $11 billion we shared our vision for future at event at beginning of monththe tesla team hyper-focused on delivering on that version all efforts are underway to make it a reality while weve achieved significant progress this year it will take time to get this as we find new incredibly complex technologies navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape future incredibly bright i want to thank tesla team once again for all their helptravis axelrod -- head of investor relationsgreat thank you very much vaibhav now well go to investor questions first one is tesla still on track to deliver more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier how does it align with your ai product road mapunknown speaker -- -- analystsure i mean as elon vaibhav both said we are on plan to meet that first half of next year ambition has always been to lower cost of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy transport part of that lowering cost of our current vehicles which where all of personally owned vehicles that we sell today come inbut next stage that really as it fits into ai road map when we bring robotaxis which lowers initial cost of getting into an ev -- those -- thats really where we see marriage of ev road map ai road mapelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah it will be like with incentive so 30k which kind of a key thresholdtravis axelrod -- head of investor relationsgreat thank you very much similar question next when can we expect tesla to give us $25000 non-robotaxi regular car modelso i think weve made very clear that were -- future autonomous i mean its going to be -- ive actually said this many years ago but that my strong belief i believe that panning out to be true very obvious retrospect that future autonomous electric vehicles nonautonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse using a foot bone its not that there are no horsesyes there are some but theyre unusual theyre niche so everything going to be electric autonomous i think this like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that futureso a lot of automotive companies most of companies have not internalized this which surprising because were shouting from rooftops for such a long time it will accrue to their detriments future but all of our vehicles future will be autonomous yesso all vehicles that weve really made almost 7 million vehicles vast majority are capable of autonomy were currently making on order of 35000 autonomous vehicles a week compare that to say waymos entire fleet its less than -- they have less than 1000 cars were making 35k a weekyeah they mostly look normal cybertruck looks thankfully abnormal cybercab robotaxi we wanted to have something futuristic-looking i think it does look futuristic its worth noting with respect to cybercab its not -- its especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution vehicle manufacturing that was also coming with cybercabthe cycle times like units per hour of cybercab line it -- like this just really something special i mean this -- will be half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines like -- not even same league what im saying not same league so its -- i said like several years ago that maybe most -- hottest tesla product probably will be battery you cant just like buy a factoryyeah its like you know [inaudible] yeah as we -- so were rapidly evolving our manufacturing technologyso anyway basically i think having a regular 25k model pointless it would be silly like it would be completely at odds with what we believeunknown speaker -- -- analystin autonomous world what matters lowest cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle thats what weve done with robotaxielon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectexactly its fully considered cost per mile what matters if you try to make a car that essentially a hybrid manual automatic car its not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yes cybercab just not going to have steering wheels pedalswhat we designed optimized for autonomy it will cost on order of -- cost roughly 25k so it a 25k car you can -- you will be able to buy one exclusively if you want so it just wont have steering wheels pedalsgreat thank you very much next question what tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centersunknown speaker -- -- analystso we aim on solving problems at source so at factory before they can even affect our customers we believe best service no service dont even have --we dont see any with test you either do it -- fix issue upstream or you would remotely do it through software maybe at work or at home or carpark weve addressed fixed issue weve partnered field with service to make sure were looking at same issuesand additionally just q3 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total of nearly 70 locations north america we significantly expanded size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah i think it was like actually a lot of merit of having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor you can start your approach -- yeah it should be more factory-like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service its way easier for somebody to become expert a few different types of repairs than every repairunknown speaker -- -- analystexactly this has helped us with base that heavy repairs like dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through really treating it like a factoryelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got good feedback with our carsunknown speaker -- -- analystyes with factory with service leaders together its sent people from factors that feel you feel for factory to see it firsthand by suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes so i view this as a structural -- a fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industryunknown speaker -- -- analystdoing a bunch of work on software side to omni diagnostics identifying what needs to be done to before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car be very efficiently worked on once it arrives so parts are there like lift scheduled technician schedule like everything do this was wrong with me tell service center carnage everythingyeah instead of a customer trying to translate car telling us directly were pulling thatelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah most time you dont need to diagnose car when it arrives car -- this like again a fundamental technology advantage structural advantage compared to rest of auto industryvaibhav taneja -- chief financial officeri think its underappreciated as to what all we are able to do thats why -- because like i said before most of our cars except for cybertruck look same so people dont realize that it has so much capabilityelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectbut they look better than other cars but theyre not like obviously super futuristictravis axelrod -- head of investor relationsgreat thank you very much next question please provide an update on semi what will next stage growth look like when will fsd be readyunknown speaker -- -- analystsure so as you -- we posted earnings were progressing swiftly on build of semi factory our data factory reno weve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program were on track to start pilot builds second half of next year with production starting first half of 2026 ramping really throughout year to full production semi growth will largely depend on our customers adoption of productelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectwell i dont think were going to be limited honestlyunknown speaker -- -- analystwhich i can say -- which like a no-brainer for semi because its really a commodity of total cost of ownershipelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes exactly we have kind of ridiculous demand for semiunknown speaker -- -- analystin that world where its about how much do i spend to go to excess lanes per mile its a no brainerelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product,0.138466,positive

138,2024-10-24,tesla stock margins bounce back for ai-leader,tesla arguably one of most advanced ai companies world yet its stock dictated by margins over past three years teslas average gross profit per vehicle has declined by 60% falling from more than $14400 q3 2021 to less than $6000 q2 2024 highlighting difficulty tesla has faced a high-interest rate environmenthigher interest rates have forced tesla to place more emphasis on affordability either via price cuts or promotional financing rates pushing average selling prices lower thus impacting margins q3s report showed that margins may have bottomed despite weakness vehicle selling prices due to that focus on affordabilityperhaps long-term story recurring software revenue from robotaxis humanoid robotics however margins are driving stock price for nowbelow i look at puts takes of an ai front runner that battling economic headwindsq3 saw tesla report sequential growth for both production deliveries after a weak q1 where deliveries dropped below 400000 for first time since late 2022 tesla reported deliveries of 462890 evs third quarter a 64% increase from last year a 43% increase from second quarterfor third quarter tesla reported automotive revenue of $1883 billion up just 13% yoy 16% qoq short of consensus estimate for $1950 billion as a result teslas overall revenue fell short of estimates with tesla reporting $2518 billion revenue nearly half a billion below consensus for $2567 billiona quick look at growth rates shows that automotive revenue growth lagged delivery growth by just over 5 percentage points at 13% versus 64% this tells investors that automotive selling prices declined once again to a large degree - q3s asp fell below $42000 down ~(17%) from q2 falling (56%) from nearly $44500 last yearnotably there risk asps fall lower q4 as tesla continues to cut some prices with cybertruck seeing up to 20% cuts on different model variants october musk mentioned that tesla would be aiming for yoy growth with just q4 left that means tesla would have to deliver more than 515000 vehicles a record high this would also imply an acceleration to 11% qoq growth leaving door open for more aggressive price cuts to spur demand something management hinted at earnings calltesla aiming high for 2025 with musk stating that automaker shooting for 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year or roughly at least 21 million vehicles assuming tesla ends 2024 at around 175 million taneja added that teslas focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a build-up of inventory to support this strategy were continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options every marketthe fed has forced tesla to focus on financing affordability which turn has been a major driver of margin issues i noted july 2023 that comment on interest rates most important comment from call as high interest rates mean tesla must lower prices that tesla was one of many tech stocks whose revenue growth profitability on borrowed time until fed instills a more dovish policydespite asps declining again sequentially profitability improved automotive margins recovered as tesla captured some tailwinds from lower raw material costs freight duties drove vehicle production costs to a record lowtesla headed into q3s report facing a tough test as average selling prices were flat vehicle production costs were rising from q4 2023 to q2 2024 asps were relatively unchanged while production costs rose 37% denting both automotive margins impacting profitability this had been hindering teslas ability to revitalize automotive gross margins -- as a result of those two changes automotive gross margins took quite a large hit falling from 172% to 146% that two-quarter spanq3 saw a sharp improvement automotive gross margin expanding ~240 bp qoq ~72 bp yoy as tesla drove production costs to a record low of ~$35106 dropping ~(46%) from $36802 just last quarterbecause of large improvements production costs average gross profit per vehicle bounced back increasing ~163% qoq to reach ~$6886 up from $5921 last quarter essentially tesla manufactured sold 14000 more vehicles this quarter for ~$220 million cheaper than last quarteroperating margin also rebounded significantly expanding to 108% q3 up from 63% q2 55% q1 this newfound operating margin growth adds more confidence margin recovery story which has been paramount for investors as share price declines have correlated quite closely with operating margin contractionenergy storage was a bright spot q3 as even with a sequential decline deployments (21%) sequential decline revenue gross margin expanded from 245% to 305% this aided company-wide gross margin expansion with tesla reporting a 198% gross margin q3 up from 180% q2q3s profitability a welcome sign yet cfo vaibhav taneja cautioned that sustaining these margins q4 however will be challenging given current economic environment due to vehicle affordability issuesinvestors may need to get comfortable with thinner margins moving forward on automotive side when stock was at all-time highs 2021 early 2022 tesla was reporting more than $14000 gross profit per vehicle or automotive gross margins high-20% range topping 30% once now average gross profit per vehicle has fallen more than (52%) to $6886 q3 with automotive gross margins back to 17% though it has remained below 20% since start of 2023this decline gross profit per vehicle stems from weaker average selling prices which have fallen quite dramatically since start of 2023 continue to fall reason margins were able to expand q3 was from reducing production costs not vehicle pricingas long as tesla continues to cut prices margin gains will be primarily realized on cost side path to higher margins will arise when tesla can push production costs towards $30000 lower once pressure on asps have resolvedmusk said q3s call that tesla still on-track to deliver more affordable models starting first half of 2025 which would require similar cost reductions to preserve margins musk also implied thin margins may be norm for investors as tesla noted that affordable model production first half of 2025 will result achieving less cost reduction than previously expectedwhile robotaxi opportunity promising for tesla its yet to provide tangible ai revenue teslas robotaxi reveal event earlier month was met with a lackluster response sending shares down more than (8%) day after as production timeline for its robotaxi was pushed back once more a familiar storyline for tesla investors over past few yearsat unveiling of teslas pedal wheel-free purpose-built robotaxi dubbed cybercab ceo elon musk said that production may begin 2026 or as late as 2027 saying that he tend[s] to be optimistic about timeframes this another years-long delay for teslas most anticipated product where 2022 musk had promised to reveal robotaxi 2023 start production 2024 this follows an initial promise from 2019 to have one million tesla vehicles equipped with level-5 autonomy 2020 years later tesla has still not deployed robotaxi which places additional emphasis on marginsmusk reiterated teslas

nov 18 2024 /cnw/ - foran mining corporation (tsx fom) (otcqx fmcxf) (foran or company) pleased to announce further copper-rich assay results from two new holes drilled into tesla zone part of forans 100%-owned mcilvenna bay property (the project) saskatchewan these holes were designed to infill two 200 x 300m gaps drill hole spacing near southern known margins of tesla zone holes successfully encountered multiple zones of mineralization as expected confirming continuity of tesla zoneclick here to watch erin carswell forans vp exploration discuss latest resultsthe recent infill drilling program at tesla zone was designed to improve confidence its grade continuity while providing critical data for potential future resource estimates potential operational expansion scenarios (see companys july 15 2024 news release) both drill holes intersected main mineralized target followed by thick copper-rich sections with additional gold content confirming consistent mineralization across zone suggesting areas of higher copper-gold grades notably drill hole ts-24-34 uncovered new copper-zinc mineralization below current tesla lenses this new opportunity highlights opportunity of additional mineralized lenses enhancing teslas growth prospects as it advances towards a potential future resource estimateerin carswell forans vice president exploration commented this summer our exploration team experimented with new techniques that allowed us to drill tesla effectively from its western side for first time reducing our reliance on ice drilling providing an exciting glimpse of southern tesla footwall rocks that we have not had before as usual with tesla zone surprises keep coming hole ts-24-34 this included discovery of a new lens of mineralization sitting just below main tesla lenses at southern end of zone addition two holes presented this release demonstrate yet again how robust tesla main lenses can be boasting multiple zones of high-grade copper high-grade zinc with pleasing thicknesses of mineralization recent results at tesla underscore its remarkable continuity unlocking possibilities for future value creation for our operations as we continue to explore this promising zonekey highlightshole ts-24-34 intersected two discrete zones of mineralization including expected tesla zone lenses plus an unexpected lower fault repetition of mineralized horizons

zone has grown into a significant mineralized body over 1200m long 500-700m wide with 45 intersections (figure 1) now defining multiple stacked lenses of copper-zinc sulphides precious metal mineralization these typically consist of zinc and/or copper-rich massive semi-massive sulphides associated copper-rich stringer mineralization higher-grade breccia zones plus emerging evidence for zones of gold-only mineralization tesla mineralization currently remains open down dip along strike for potential continued expansion futureduring summer-fall 2024 a total of approximately 10810m of drilling was completed as a series of pilot holes wedges from four main collars located southern part of tesla zone targeting larger gaps current drill hole spacing as we strive to confirm teslas continuity tenor drill holes were collared on land covering approximately 300m of strike length of zone drilled from footwall side using directional drilling to provide perpendicular intersections into mineralized horizons a total of seven tesla pierce points were obtained during summer-fall 2024 programthis release presents results of two significant drill holes (ts-24-29 ts-24-34) from summer infill drill program these holes targeted two large gaps drilling measuring approximately 200m x 300m along strike down dip respectively both instances (figure 2) both were successful confirming continuity of mineralization multiple lenses through southern part of tesla zone ts-24-34 also intersected an unexpected interval of mineralization a lower fault slice located below southern end of tesla horizon proximal to bridge zone this may correlate with deeper mineralization intersected sporadically holes such as ts-23-11w2 ts-24-290 a drilling density map provided figure 2 which shows locations of intersections from summer drill program relative to previous drilling importance of these holes for establishing continuity between wider-spaced drill holests-24-29ts-24-29 targeted a 200m x 300m gap between existing drill holes where previous drilling had intersected significant zones of mineralization hole was drilled from footwall side of tesla zone so it intersected lenses reverse stratigraphic order ts-24-29 intersected expected stratigraphy mineralized horizons that match well with surrounding drill holes results of ts-24-29 also match well with results from previously released ts-24-30 (located approximately 200m to northeast) that returned a combined 365m interval of stringer-style mineralization from upper copper lens followed directly downhole by main massive sulphide lens a thick zone of stringer/breccia-style copper mineralization (see forans october 7 2024 news release) ts-24-29 intersected same mineralized package but this location lower copper lens was split into two separate lenses (measuring 99m 262m respectively) by a late quartz-feldspar porphyry (qfp) dyke that intruded stratigraphy from 12803-12835m a cross section through tesla zone showing relationship of ts-24-29 with surrounding drill holes provided figure 3 belowin detail ts-24-29 intersected a narrow copper stringer zone at top of mineralized interval that was 20m length grading 076% cu 026 g/t au this zone correlates with an upper copper lens that sits above main massive sulphide lens as was seen previously released ts-24-30 throughout much of tesla zone directly below upper copper lens a 24m horizon of massive to semi-massive sulphide was intersected grading 064% cu 1364% zn 371 g/t ag 027 g/t au dominantly consisting of massive pyrite with strong fine-grained sphalerite groundmass minor chalcopyrite mineralization a strongly chlorite-altered host rock below massive sulphides hole intersected lower copper lens which this case consisted of

foliated chlorite and/or sericite altered felsic volcanic host rock at this location lower copper lens cut by a late qfp dyke which intruded stratigraphy effectively splits lower copper zone into two lenses a 262m interval grading 168% cu followed by a 99m interval below dyke grading 114% cuimages of high-grade copper mineralization are shown figure 3 below a cross section demonstrating relationship of ts-24-29 to surrounding drill holes provided figure 4 on following page detailed composite intervals from 2024 summer drill program are provided table 1ts-24-34ts-24-34 also targeted another large 200 x 300m gap between existing drill holes an area of limited drilling near southern end of tesla hole successfully intersected tesla zone close proximity to bridge zone this drill hole not only intersected main tesla mineralized horizons confirming their continuity but also intersected an additional zone of mineralization when compared to ts-24-29 which appears to represent faulted offset a repeat of tesla mineralization an interpreted lower fault slice that likely related to folding faulting that emplaced tesla zone its current position relative to mcilvenna bay this additional zone of mineralization was also intersected previously released drill hole ts-23-11w2 (see forans may 25 2023 news release) which intersected a similar contiguous zone of mineralization consisting of massive sulphide stringer-style mineralization approximately 350m further downdip that graded 193% cu178% zn 310 g/t ag over 44m (figure 6) additional drilling will be required this area to define extent of this mineralized horizon relationship of this fault slice with tesla bridge zoneoverall ts-24-34 intersected a 68m interval of main lens massive sulphide at stratigraphic top of tesla zone dominantly consisting of massive pyrite with lesser chalcopyrite sphalerite a strongly chlorite altered host rock which graded 162% copper 484% zinc directly below massive sulphide hole intersected a zone of strong breccia stringer sulphides over 84m which contained significant copper gold mineralization grading 238% copper 189 g/t au this interval speaks to potential that exists at tesla to intersect additional high-grade copper-gold intervals as infill drilling continues this copper-gold intersection was followed by a second broad zone of dominantly stringer-style mineralization over 222m which graded 130% copper finally ts-24-34 intersected an additional mineralized horizon footwall below tesla this footwall mineralization generally hosted strongly foliated locally brecciated units shows a similar combination of stringer-style mineralization massive sulphide as seen at tesla itself including 17m of massive sulphide grading 437% copper 1547% zinc followed by multiple narrow

142,2024-10-24,tesla (tsla) q3 2024 earnings call transcript,and im not -- to best of my knowledge there was no ev division of any company of any existing car company that profitable so it notable that tesla profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment this quarter actually a record q3 for us so we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday so congratulations to teams that made it happen tesla thats staggering immense amount of work to make 7 million carsso you see we all have -- energy storage business growing like wildfire with strong demand for both megapack powerwall as you all know on october 10 we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that i think very compelling that tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience future where you have humanoid robots working among craft not with a canned video a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks whatnot we had 50 autonomous vehicles there were 20 cybercabs but there were an additional 30 model ys operating fully autonomously entire night carrying thousands of people with no incidents entire nightand all those who went there that worth emphasizing that cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to whole night went very smoothly so regarding vehicle business we are still on track to deliver our affordable models starting first half of 2025 this -- i think probably people want should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year at risk of -- to take a bit of risk here i do want to give some rough estimate which i think its 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year notwithstanding negative external events like if theres some force majeure events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like thatwe cant overcome massive force majeure events but i think with our lower-cost vehicles with advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year my best guess then cybercab reaching volume production 26 i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 just starting production reaching volume production 26and that should be substantial but were aiming for at least 2 million units a year of cybercab that will be more than one factory but i think its at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimately so yes these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses those are my best guesses cell 4680 lines team actually doing great work therethe 4680 rapidly approaching point where it most competitive cell so when you consider fully landed -- cost of a battery pack fully landed us net of incentives duties 4680 tracking to be most competitive maybe lower cost per kilowatt hour fully considered than any other alternative which -- were not quite there yet but were close to being there which i think extremely exciting weve got several -- a lot of ideas to go well beyond that so i think theres -- if we execute well 4680 -- well have -- tesla internally produced cell will be most cost competitive cell north america a testament to tremendous amount of hard work there done by teamso thats to say well continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors i tend not to provide -- to make cells just internally so i dont want to sort of here were obviously increasing substantially our vehicle output our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cellsand most of them will still come from suppliers but i think it some good news that tesla internal cell likely to be most competitive us so with respect to autonomy as people are experiencing cars really from week to week there are significant improvements miles between interventions so with new version 125 release of full self-driving cybertruck combining code into a single stack so that city driving engine highway driving are one stack which a big improvement for highway drivingso its just all neural nets release of actually smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here were also -- so thats 125 version 13 of fsd going out soonwill elaborate more on that later call we expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement miles between interventions compared to 125 actually looking at year as whole improvement miles interventions we think will be at least three orders of magnitude so thats a very dramatic improvement course of year we expect that trend to continue next yearso current total expectation internal expectation for tesla fsd having longer miles between versions than human second quarter of next year which means it may end up being third quarter but its next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year ashok do you want to say anythingashok elluswamy -- director autopilot softwareyeah miles between critical interventions like you mentioned elon we already made 100x improvement with 125 from starting of this year then with v13 release we expect to be 1000x from beginning from january of this year on production software this came because of technology improvements going to end to end having higher frame rate partly also helped by hardware force more capabilities so onand we hope that we continue to scale neural network data training compute etc by q2 next year we should cross over average even miles per critical intervention collision that caseelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architecti mean that just unvarnished our internal estimateso thats not sandbagging or anything else our internal estimate q2 of next year to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter a vast majority of humanity has no idea that tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a model 3 or model y it looks like a normal car so you dont expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itselfa cybercab looks different a cybertruck looks different but model y model 3 are -- look theyre good-looking cars but look fairly normal you dont expect a fairly normal-looking car to have intelligence enough ai to be able to drive itself but it does so we do want to expose that to more people so were doing -- every time we have a significant improvement software well roll out another sort of 30-day trial to encourage people to try it againand we are seeing a significant improvement adoption so take rate for fsd has improved substantially especially after 10/10 event yes so theres no need to wait for robotaxi or cybercab to experience full autonomywe expect to achieve that next year with -- with our existing vehicle lineashok elluswamy -- director autopilot softwarei wanted to actually spot someone gives a small taste of what its going to look like car able to drive itself to user within private parking lots currently its speed-limited but then its going to quickly be increased we already had more than 1 billion usage terms of smart summonelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectye we actually -- we have for tesla employees bay area we already are offering ride-hailing capabilities so you can actually -- with development app you can request a ride it will take you anywhere bay areawe do have a safety driver for now but its not required to do that weve developed -- i mean david do you want to elaborate on thatdavid lau -- vice president software engineeringyeah sure its david we showed some screenshots of this q1 shareholder deck this real weve been testing it for good part of yearand building blocks that we needed order to build this functionality deliver it to production weve been thinking about working on for years it just so happens that weve used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers meantime such as sharing your profile synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into whether its another car that you own or a car that somebody has loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into it looks exactly like yours everything synchronized seat mirror positions media navigation everything same just what you would expect from one of our robotaxis but we gave that functionality to our customers right now because weve built it intending for it to be used future but were releasing that functionality nowall end-to-end cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality sending a navigation destination from your phone to vehicle so were doing that now with ride-hailing app but its something that weve made available to customers for years seeing progress on a route mobile app thats something youll need for ride-hailing app but again we released it meantime so its not like were just starting to think about this stuff right now while were building out early stages of our ride-hailing networkweve been thinking about this for quite a long time were excited to get functionality out thereelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectand we do expect to roll out ride-hailing california texas next year to public now california somewhere -- theres quite a long regulatory approval process i think we should get approval next year but its contingent upon regulatory approval texas a lot faster so its -- well definitely have available texas probably have it available california subject to regulatory approvaland then -- maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least california texas so i think that would be very exciting thats really a profound change tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle a battery manufacturing company at that pointso we published q3 vehicle safety report which shows one crash for every 7 million miles of autopilot that compares to us average of one crash roughly every 700000 miles so its currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to usaverage we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate needs of both fsd optimus we are currently not training compute-constrained probably biggest limiting factor of fsd actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakesand when you start getting to where it can take 10000 miles to find a mistake it takes a while to actually figure out which it is software a better than software b it actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them makes mistakes -- would take a long time to make mistakes so its actually single biggest limiting factor how long does it take us to figure out which version better sort of a high-class problem obviously having a drone fleet very helpful for breaking this outand then with optimus we showed a massive improvement optimus dexterity improvement on october 10 our next-gen hand forearm which 22 degrees of freedom which double prior hand or forearm its extremely human-like so its much better at tactile sensing its really -- i feel confident saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot were moreover only company that really has all of ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robotsbecause things that -- what other companies are missing that theyre missing ai brain that theyre missing people to really scale to very high-volume production so you see some impressive video demos but what like localized ai volume to very high numbers as ive said on a few occasions before i think optimus will ultimately be most valuable part so i think has a good chance of being most viable product that we made for energy business thats doing extremely welland opportunity ahead gigantic lathrop megapack factory reached 200 megapacks a week which now a 40-gigawatt hour a year run rate we have a second factory shanghai that will begin with 20-gigawatt hour a year run rate q1 next year so next quarter that will also scale outit wont be long before were shipping 100-gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at tesla will that -- i mean that will ultimately grow i think to multiple terawatt hours per year it has to actually order to have a sustainable energy future if youre not at terawatt scale youre not really moving needleso if you look at our very complicated last master plan which i think actually too much detail ill maybe ask to analyze it give us tldr on management plan we shared that master plan that it possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation batteries electric transport there were no fundamental material limitations like theres not some very rare material that we dont have enough of we actually have enough with raw materials to take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable dramatically increased its trust usage would still be fully sustainableone way to think of progress of a civilization this may sound a little esoteric but percentage completion of scale so [inaudible] scale one would be youre using all power of a planet were currently less than 1% on level 1 level 2 would be using all power of sun level 3 all of power of galaxy so weve got a long way to go long way to gowhen you think of courtship terms it becomes obvious

primarily due to impact of financing incentivesas a reminder we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks financial institutions recognize cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue we released fsd for cybertruck other features like actually smart summon like elon talked about north america which contributed $326 million of revenues quarter we continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year to expand on this at an industry level china continues to outperform usand europe by a factor of three if there something to be learned from that this gives a signal of what to come other regions as customers acceptance of ev growth we feel that right strategy to build affordable more compelling leads our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventoryto support this strategy were continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options when you compare any vehicle our lineup with other oems we believe our vehicles provide much better value particularly when you consider safety features performance unparalleled software functionalities like david also talked about include also what ashok had talked about around autonomy music options parental controls much more while every vehicle our lineup comes up with these capabilities there an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners we plan on making these more visible our interactions with both existing future customers automotive margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of a feature release discussed beforeincrease our overall production delivery volume benefit from marketing pricing more localized deliveries region which resulted lower freight duties sustaining these margins q4 however will be challenging given current economic environment note that we are focused on cost per vehicle there are numerous work streams within company to squeeze out cost without compromising on customer experienceelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah im assuming thats a helpful -- hopefully a helpful macro trend if theres a decline interest rates this has a massive effect on automotive demand because vast majority of people -- demand driven by monthly payment can they afford monthly payment so most likely well see continued decline interest rates which helps with affordability of vehiclesvaibhav taneja -- chief financial officeryeah i mean that one trend which we observed industry thats because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates people are holding on to their cars longer especially us that actually having an impact on overall industry tooas we discussed earlier as we discussed back orders energy deployments fluctuate quarter on quarter due to customer readiness location of orders being fulfilled not necessarily an indicator of demand of production within quarter while we did see a decline q3 we expect to grow deployment sequentially q4 to end year with more than double of last year energy margins q3 were a record at more than 30% this a function of mix of projects being deployed quarternote that there will be fluctuation margins as we manage through deployments our inventory our pipeline backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots we are doing our best to keep up with demand just coming back on automotive margins i talked about -- sorry i talked about what happeningone other thing which i want to also share that were seeing -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to like i said before about squeezing of cost but this something which we also are very capable of i mean just q3 we faced our lowest cost per vehicle that a trend which we want to keep focused on then going on to service otherwe continue to show improvements q3 this was a result of better performance both our service as well as it includes collision part sales merchandise continued growth supercharging these fee-based revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter on year-on-year basisthis partially due to restructuring we undertook q2 cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase costs related to our ai efforts weve started using gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead of schedule are on track to get 50000 gpus deployed texas by end of this month one thing which id like to elaborate that were being really judicious on our ai compute spend to saying how best we can utilize existing infrastructure before making further investmentson capex front we had about $35 billion quarter this was a sequential increase largely because of investments ai compute we now expect our capex for year to be excess of $11 billion we shared our vision for future at event at beginning of monththe tesla team hyper-focused on delivering on that version all efforts are underway to make it a reality while weve achieved significant progress this year it will take time to get this as we find new incredibly complex technologies navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape future incredibly bright i want to thank tesla team once again for all their helptravis axelrod -- head of investor relationsgreat thank you very much vaibhav now well go to investor questions first one is tesla still on track to deliver more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier how does it align with your ai product road mapunknown speaker -- -- analystsure i mean as elon vaibhav both said we are on plan to meet that first half of next year ambition has always been to lower cost of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy transport part of that lowering cost of our current vehicles which where all of personally owned vehicles that we sell today come inbut next stage that really as it fits into ai road map when we bring robotaxis which lowers initial cost of getting into an ev -- those -- thats really where we see marriage of ev road map ai road mapelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah it will be like with incentive so 30k which kind of a key thresholdtravis axelrod -- head of investor relationsgreat thank you very much similar question next when can we expect tesla to give us $25000 non-robotaxi regular car modelso i think weve made very clear that were -- future autonomous i mean its going to be -- ive actually said this many years ago but that my strong belief i believe that panning out to be true very obvious retrospect that future autonomous electric vehicles nonautonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse using a foot bone its not that there are no horsesyes there are some but theyre unusual theyre niche so everything going to be electric autonomous i think this like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that futureso a lot of automotive companies most of companies have not internalized this which surprising because were shouting from rooftops for such a long time it will accrue to their detriments future but all of our vehicles future will be autonomous yesso all vehicles that weve really made almost 7 million vehicles vast majority are capable of autonomy were currently making on order of 35000 autonomous vehicles a week compare that to say waymos entire fleet its less than -- they have less than 1000 cars were making 35k a weekyeah they mostly look normal cybertruck looks thankfully abnormal cybercab robotaxi we wanted to have something futuristic-looking i think it does look futuristic its worth noting with respect to cybercab its not -- its especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution vehicle manufacturing that was also coming with cybercabthe cycle times like units per hour of cybercab line it -- like this just really something special i mean this -- will be half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines like -- not even same league what im saying not same league so its -- i said like several years ago that maybe most -- hottest tesla product probably will be battery you cant just like buy a factoryyeah its like you know [inaudible] yeah as we -- so were rapidly evolving our manufacturing technologyso anyway basically i think having a regular 25k model pointless it would be silly like it would be completely at odds with what we believeunknown speaker -- -- analystin autonomous world what matters lowest cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle thats what weve done with robotaxielon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectexactly its fully considered cost per mile what matters if you try to make a car that essentially a hybrid manual automatic car its not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yes cybercab just not going to have steering wheels pedalswhat we designed optimized for autonomy it will cost on order of -- cost roughly 25k so it a 25k car you can -- you will be able to buy one exclusively if you want so it just wont have steering wheels pedalsgreat thank you very much next question what tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centersunknown speaker -- -- analystso we aim on solving problems at source so at factory before they can even affect our customers we believe best service no service dont even have --we dont see any with test you either do it -- fix issue upstream or you would remotely do it through software maybe at work or at home or carpark weve addressed fixed issue weve partnered field with service to make sure were looking at same issuesand additionally just q3 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total of nearly 70 locations north america we significantly expanded size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah i think it was like actually a lot of merit of having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor you can start your approach -- yeah it should be more factory-like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service its way easier for somebody to become expert a few different types of repairs than every repairunknown speaker -- -- analystexactly this has helped us with base that heavy repairs like dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through really treating it like a factoryelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got good feedback with our carsunknown speaker -- -- analystyes with factory with service leaders together its sent people from factors that feel you feel for factory to see it firsthand by suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes so i view this as a structural -- a fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industryunknown speaker -- -- analystdoing a bunch of work on software side to omni diagnostics identifying what needs to be done to before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car be very efficiently worked on once it arrives so parts are there like lift scheduled technician schedule like everything do this was wrong with me tell service center carnage everythingyeah instead of a customer trying to translate car telling us directly were pulling thatelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah most time you dont need to diagnose car when it arrives car -- this like again a fundamental technology advantage structural advantage compared to rest of auto industryvaibhav taneja -- chief financial officeri think its underappreciated as to what all we are able to do thats why -- because like i said before most of our cars except for cybertruck look same so people dont realize that it has so much capabilityelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectbut they look better than other cars but theyre not like obviously super futuristictravis axelrod -- head of investor relationsgreat thank you very much next question please provide an update on semi what will next stage growth look like when will fsd be readyunknown speaker -- -- analystsure so as you -- we posted earnings were progressing swiftly on build of semi factory our data factory reno weve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program were on track to start pilot builds second half of next year with production starting first half of 2026 ramping really throughout year to full production semi growth will largely depend on our customers adoption of productelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectwell i dont think were going to be limited honestlyunknown speaker -- -- analystwhich i can say -- which like a no-brainer for semi because its really a commodity of total cost of ownershipelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes exactly we have kind of ridiculous demand for semiunknown speaker -- -- analystin that world where its about how much do i spend to go to excess lanes per mile its a no brainerelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes fundamentally if youve got a semi fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport better than a diesel truck any company that doesnt adopt an electric semi will lose its not a subjective thingits like whether do you like just competitive -- we want stat -- we want to have a good old semi truck but frankly if we made a good old semi truck would it matterunknown speaker -- -- analystand this proving so our fleets pepsis partner fact pepsi actually said last week theyre having -- nobody wants -- their drivers dont want to go backelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah as soon as we gave anyone electric semi thats like choiceyeah thats like -- so more senior like their top drivers will -- they get to drive a tesla semi its thing they want to drive its super fun to driveits easy to drive it hauls ass its like fastwell -- but i mean like youve seen like videos that were like -- like tesla electric semi can go uphill just speeding fast like diesel truck or even cars so like its responsive its -- you floor it that truck actually hurtunknown speaker -- -- analystand thats a benefit not only for driver for goods but also for safety terms of other drivers on road you dont get stuck behind semi youre not like a slowdown situation -- i mean how that plays into fsd which second part of question all of this have been a couple of hundred weve deployed already ones that well be building next year throughout future how all of hardware camera necessary to deploy fsd were currently training with that small we have as soon as fleet trained neural that there up well get fsd onto that platformelon reeve musk,0.132093,positive
143,2024-10-24,tesla (tsla) q3 2024 earnings call transcript | motley fool,good afternoon everyone welcome to teslas third quarter 2024 q&a webcast my name travis axelrod head of investor relations im joined today by elon musk vaibhav taneja a number of other executives our q3 results were announced at about 300 pm central time update deck we published at same link as webcastduring this call we will discuss our business outlook make forward-looking statements these comments are based on our predictions expectations as of today actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks uncertainties including those mentioned our most recent filings with sec during question-and-answer portion of todays call please limit yourself to one question one follow-up[operator instructions] before we jump into q&a elon has some opening remarks elonelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectthank you so to recap as someone was saying something that what -- industry was seeing year-over-year declines order volumes q3 tesla at same time has achieved record deliveries fact i think if you look at ev companies worldwide to best of my knowledge no ev company even profitableand im not -- to best of my knowledge there was no ev division of any company of any existing car company that profitable so it notable that tesla profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment this quarter actually a record q3 for us so we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday so congratulations to teams that made it happen tesla thats staggering immense amount of work to make 7 million carsso you see we all have -- energy storage business growing like wildfire with strong demand for both megapack powerwall as you all know on october 10 we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that i think very compelling that tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience future where you have humanoid robots working among craft not with a canned video a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks whatnot we had 50 autonomous vehicles there were 20 cybercabs but there were an additional 30 model ys operating fully autonomously entire night carrying thousands of people with no incidents entire nightand all those who went there that worth emphasizing that cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to whole night went very smoothly so regarding vehicle business we are still on track to deliver our affordable models starting first half of 2025 this -- i think probably people want should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year at risk of -- to take a bit of risk here i do want to give some rough estimate which i think its 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year notwithstanding negative external events like if theres some force majeure events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like thatwe cant overcome massive force majeure events but i think with our lower-cost vehicles with advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year my best guess then cybercab reaching volume production 26 i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 just starting production reaching volume production 26and that should be substantial but were aiming for at least 2 million units a year of cybercab that will be more than one factory but i think its at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimately so yes these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses those are my best guesses cell 4680 lines team actually doing great work therethe 4680 rapidly approaching point where it most competitive cell so when you consider fully landed -- cost of a battery pack fully landed us net of incentives duties 4680 tracking to be most competitive maybe lower cost per kilowatt hour fully considered than any other alternative which -- were not quite there yet but were close to being there which i think extremely exciting weve got several -- a lot of ideas to go well beyond that so i think theres -- if we execute well 4680 -- well have -- tesla internally produced cell will be most cost competitive cell north america a testament to tremendous amount of hard work there done by teamso thats to say well continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors i tend not to provide -- to make cells just internally so i dont want to sort of here were obviously increasing substantially our vehicle output our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cellsand most of them will still come from suppliers but i think it some good news that tesla internal cell likely to be most competitive us so with respect to autonomy as people are experiencing cars really from week to week there are significant improvements miles between interventions so with new version 125 release of full self-driving cybertruck combining code into a single stack so that city driving engine highway driving are one stack which a big improvement for highway drivingso its just all neural nets release of actually smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here were also -- so thats 125 version 13 of fsd going out soonwill elaborate more on that later call we expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement miles between interventions compared to 125 actually looking at year as whole improvement miles interventions we think will be at least three orders of magnitude so thats a very dramatic improvement course of year we expect that trend to continue next yearso current total expectation internal expectation for tesla fsd having longer miles between versions than human second quarter of next year which means it may end up being third quarter but its next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year ashok do you want to say anythingashok elluswamy -- director autopilot softwareyeah miles between critical interventions like you mentioned elon we already made 100x improvement with 125 from starting of this year then with v13 release we expect to be 1000x from beginning from january of this year on production software this came because of technology improvements going to end to end having higher frame rate partly also helped by hardware force more capabilities so onand we hope that we continue to scale neural network data training compute etc by q2 next year we should cross over average even miles per critical intervention collision that caseelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architecti mean that just unvarnished our internal estimateso thats not sandbagging or anything else our internal estimate q2 of next year to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter a vast majority of humanity has no idea that tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a model 3 or model y it looks like a normal car so you dont expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itselfa cybercab looks different a cybertruck looks different but model y model 3 are -- look theyre good-looking cars but look fairly normal you dont expect a fairly normal-looking car to have intelligence enough ai to be able to drive itself but it does so we do want to expose that to more people so were doing -- every time we have a significant improvement software well roll out another sort of 30-day trial to encourage people to try it againand we are seeing a significant improvement adoption so take rate for fsd has improved substantially especially after 10/10 event yes so theres no need to wait for robotaxi or cybercab to experience full autonomywe expect to achieve that next year with -- with our existing vehicle lineashok elluswamy -- director autopilot softwarei wanted to actually spot someone gives a small taste of what its going to look like car able to drive itself to user within private parking lots currently its speed-limited but then its going to quickly be increased we already had more than 1 billion usage terms of smart summonelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectye we actually -- we have for tesla employees bay area we already are offering ride-hailing capabilities so you can actually -- with development app you can request a ride it will take you anywhere bay areawe do have a safety driver for now but its not required to do that weve developed -- i mean david do you want to elaborate on thatdavid lau -- vice president software engineeringyeah sure its david we showed some screenshots of this q1 shareholder deck this real weve been testing it for good part of yearand building blocks that we needed order to build this functionality deliver it to production weve been thinking about working on for years it just so happens that weve used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers meantime such as sharing your profile synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into whether its another car that you own or a car that somebody has loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into it looks exactly like yours everything synchronized seat mirror positions media navigation everything same just what you would expect from one of our robotaxis but we gave that functionality to our customers right now because weve built it intending for it to be used future but were releasing that functionality nowall end-to-end cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality sending a navigation destination from your phone to vehicle so were doing that now with ride-hailing app but its something that weve made available to customers for years seeing progress on a route mobile app thats something youll need for ride-hailing app but again we released it meantime so its not like were just starting to think about this stuff right now while were building out early stages of our ride-hailing networkweve been thinking about this for quite a long time were excited to get functionality out thereelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectand we do expect to roll out ride-hailing california texas next year to public now california somewhere -- theres quite a long regulatory approval process i think we should get approval next year but its contingent upon regulatory approval texas a lot faster so its -- well definitely have available texas probably have it available california subject to regulatory approvaland then -- maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least california texas so i think that would be very exciting thats really a profound change tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle a battery manufacturing company at that pointso we published q3 vehicle safety report which shows one crash for every 7 million miles of autopilot that compares to us average of one crash roughly every 700000 miles so its currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to usaverage we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate needs of both fsd optimus we are currently not training compute-constrained probably biggest limiting factor of fsd actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakesand when you start getting to where it can take 10000 miles to find a mistake it takes a while to actually figure out which it is software a better than software b it actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them makes mistakes -- would take a long time to make mistakes so its actually single biggest limiting factor how long does it take us to figure out which version better sort of a high-class problem obviously having a drone fleet very helpful for breaking this outand then with optimus we showed a massive improvement optimus dexterity improvement on october 10 our next-gen hand forearm which 22 degrees of freedom which double prior hand or forearm its extremely human-like so its much better at tactile sensing its really -- i feel confident saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot were moreover only company that really has all of ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robotsbecause things that -- what other companies are missing that theyre missing ai brain that theyre missing people to really scale to very high-volume production so you see some impressive video demos but what like localized ai volume to very high numbers as ive said on a few occasions before i think optimus will ultimately be most valuable part so i think has a good chance of being most viable product that we made for energy business thats doing extremely welland opportunity ahead gigantic lathrop megapack factory reached 200 megapacks a week which now a 40-gigawatt hour a year run rate we have a second factory shanghai that will begin with 20-gigawatt hour a year run rate q1 next year so next quarter that will also scale outit wont be long before were shipping 100-gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at tesla will that -- i mean that will ultimately grow i think to multiple terawatt hours per year it has to actually order to have a sustainable energy future if youre not at terawatt scale youre not really moving needleso if you look at our very complicated last master plan which i think actually too much detail ill maybe ask to analyze it give us tldr on management plan we shared that master plan that it possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation batteries electric transport there were no fundamental material limitations like theres not some very rare material that we dont have enough of we actually have enough with raw materials to take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable dramatically increased its trust usage would still be fully sustainableone way to think of progress of a civilization this may sound a little esoteric but percentage completion of scale so [inaudible] scale one would be youre using all power of a planet were currently less than 1% on level 1 level 2 would be using all power of sun level 3 all of power of galaxy so weve got a long way to go long way to gowhen you think of courtship terms it becomes obvious that by far biggest source of energy sun everything else so conclusion tesla focused on building future of energy transport robotics ai this a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trendswe think what were doing right approach if we execute on our objectives i think we will my prediction tesla will become most valuable company world probably by a long shot i want to thank tesla team once again for strong

with service to make sure were looking at same issuesand additionally just q3 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total of nearly 70 locations north america we significantly expanded size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah i think it was like actually a lot of merit of having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor you can start your approach -- yeah it should be more factory-like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service its way easier for somebody to become expert a few different types of repairs than every repairunknown speaker -- -- analystexactly this has helped us with base that heavy repairs like dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through really treating it like a factoryelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got good feedback with our carsunknown speaker -- -- analystyes with factory with service leaders together its sent people from factors that feel you feel for factory to see it firsthand by suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes so i view this as a structural -- a fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industryunknown speaker -- -- analystdoing a bunch of work on software side to omni diagnostics identifying what needs to be done to before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car be very efficiently worked on once it arrives so parts are there like lift scheduled technician schedule like everything do this was wrong with me tell service center carnage everythingyeah instead of a customer trying to translate car telling us directly were pulling thatelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyeah most time you dont need to diagnose car when it arrives car -- this like again a fundamental technology advantage structural advantage compared to rest of auto industryvaibhav taneja -- chief financial officeri think its underappreciated as to what all we are able to do thats why -- because like i said before most of our cars except for cybertruck look same so people dont realize that it has so much capabilityelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectbut they look better than other cars but theyre not like obviously super futuristictravis axelrod -- head of investor relationsgreat thank you very much next question please provide an update on semi what will next stage growth look like when will fsd be readyunknown speaker -- -- analystsure so as you -- we posted earnings were progressing swiftly on build of semi factory our data factory reno weve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program were on track to start pilot builds second half of next year with production starting first half of 2026 ramping really throughout year to full production semi growth will largely depend on our customers adoption of productelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectwell i dont think were going to be limited honestlyunknown speaker -- -- analystwhich i can say -- which like a no-brainer for semi because its really a commodity of total cost of ownershipelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes exactly we have kind of ridiculous demand for semiunknown speaker -- -- analystin that world where its about how much do i spend to go to excess lanes per mile its a no brainerelon reeve musk -- chief executive officer product architectyes fundamentally if youve got a semi fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport better than a diesel truck any company that doesnt adopt an electric semi will lose its not a subjective thingits like whether do you like just competitive -- we want stat -- we want to have a good old semi truck but frankly if we made a good old semi truck would it matterunknown speaker -- -- analystand this proving so our fleets pepsis partner fact pepsi actually said

footwallvancouver bc  nov 18 2024 /cnw/ - foran mining corporation (tsx fom) (otcqx fmcxf) (foran or company) pleased to announce further copper-rich assay results from two new holes drilled into tesla zone part of forans 100%-owned mcilvenna bay property (the project) saskatchewan  these holes were designed to infill two 200 x 300m gaps drill hole spacing near southern known margins of tesla zone holes successfully encountered multiple zones of mineralization as expected confirming continuity of tesla zoneclick here to watch erin carswell  forans vp exploration discuss latest resultsthe recent infill drilling program at tesla zone was designed to improve confidence its grade continuity while providing critical data for potential future resource estimates potential operational expansion scenarios (see companys july 15 2024 news release) both drill holes intersected main mineralized target followed by thick copper-rich sections with additional gold content confirming consistent mineralization across zone suggesting areas of higher copper-gold grades notably drill hole ts-24-34 uncovered new copper-zinc mineralization below current tesla lenses this new opportunity highlights opportunity of additional mineralized lenses enhancing teslas growth prospects as it advances towards a potential future resource estimateerin carswell  forans vice president exploration commented this summer our exploration team experimented with new techniques that allowed us to drill tesla effectively from its western side for first time reducing our reliance on ice drilling providing an exciting glimpse of southern tesla footwall rocks that we have not had before as usual with tesla zone surprises keep coming  hole ts-24-34 this included discovery of a new lens of mineralization sitting just below main tesla lenses at southern end of zone addition two holes presented this release demonstrate yet again how robust tesla main lenses can be boasting multiple zones of high-grade copper high-grade zinc with pleasing thicknesses of mineralization recent results at tesla underscore its remarkable continuity unlocking possibilities for future value creation for our operations as we continue to explore this promising zonekey highlightshole ts-24-34 intersected two discrete zones of mineralization including expected tesla zone lenses plus an unexpected lower fault repetition of mineralized horizons highlights from main tesla lenses include 68m of copper zinc-rich massive sulphide grading 162% cu 484% zn 333 g/t ag 028 g/t au (323% cueq) which was followed by

zonesince its discovery 2022 tesla zone has grown into a significant mineralized body over 1200m long 500-700m wide with 45 intersections (figure 1) now defining multiple stacked lenses of copper-zinc sulphides precious metal mineralization these typically consist of zinc and/or copper-rich massive semi-massive sulphides associated copper-rich stringer mineralization higher-grade breccia zones plus emerging evidence for zones of gold-only mineralization tesla mineralization currently remains open down dip along strike for potential continued expansion futureduring summer-fall 2024 a total of approximately 10810m of drilling was completed as a series of pilot holes wedges from four main collars located southern part of tesla zone targeting larger gaps current drill hole spacing as we strive to confirm teslas continuity tenor drill holes were collared on land covering approximately 300m of strike length of zone drilled from footwall side using directional drilling to provide perpendicular intersections into mineralized horizons a total of seven tesla pierce points were obtained during summer-fall 2024 programthis release presents results of two significant drill holes (ts-24-29 ts-24-34) from summer infill drill program these holes targeted two large gaps drilling measuring approximately 200m x 300m along strike down dip respectively both instances (figure 2) both were successful confirming continuity of mineralization multiple lenses through southern part of tesla zone ts-24-34 also intersected an unexpected interval of mineralization a lower fault slice located below southern end of tesla horizon proximal to bridge zone this may correlate with deeper mineralization intersected sporadically holes such as ts-23-11w2 ts-24-290 a drilling density map provided figure 2 which shows locations of intersections from summer drill program relative to previous drilling importance of these holes for establishing continuity between wider-spaced drill holests-24- 29ts-24-29 targeted a 200m x 300m gap between existing drill holes where previous drilling had intersected significant zones of mineralization hole was drilled from footwall side of tesla zone so it intersected lenses reverse stratigraphic order ts-24-29 intersected expected stratigraphy mineralized horizons that match well with surrounding drill holes results of ts-24-29 also match well with results from previously released ts-24-30 (located approximately 200m to northeast) that returned a combined 365m interval of stringer-style mineralization from upper copper lens followed directly downhole by main massive sulphide lens a thick zone of stringer/breccia-style copper mineralization (see forans october 7 2024 news release) ts-24-29 intersected same mineralized package but this location lower copper lens was split into two separate lenses (measuring 99m 262m respectively) by a late quartz-feldspar porphyry (qfp) dyke that intruded stratigraphy from 12803-12835m  a cross section through tesla zone showing relationship of ts-24-29 with surrounding drill holes provided figure 3 belowin detail ts-24-29 intersected a narrow copper stringer zone at top of mineralized interval that was 20m length grading 076% cu 026 g/t au this zone correlates with an upper copper lens that sits above main massive sulphide lens as was seen previously released ts-24-30 throughout much of tesla zone directly below upper copper lens a 24m horizon of massive to semi-massive sulphide was intersected grading 064% cu 1364% zn 371 g/t ag 027 g/t au dominantly consisting of massive pyrite with strong fine-grained sphalerite groundmass minor chalcopyrite mineralization a strongly chlorite-altered host rock below massive sulphides hole intersected lower copper lens which this case consisted of several wide copper-rich zones made up mostly of stringer-style mineralization with local breccia zones dominantly consisting of pyrite chalcopyrite with minor pyrrhotite sphalerite a strongly foliated chlorite and/or sericite altered felsic volcanic host rock at this location lower copper lens cut by a late qfp dyke which intruded stratigraphy effectively splits lower copper zone

another large 200 x 300m gap between existing drill holes an area of limited drilling near southern end of tesla hole successfully intersected tesla zone close proximity to bridge zone this drill hole not only intersected main tesla mineralized horizons confirming their continuity but also intersected an additional zone of mineralization when compared to ts-24-29 which appears to represent faulted offset a repeat of tesla mineralization an interpreted lower fault slice that likely related to folding faulting that emplaced tesla zone its current position relative to mcilvenna bay this additional zone of mineralization was also intersected previously released drill hole ts-23-11w2 (see forans may 25 2023 news release) which intersected a similar contiguous zone of mineralization consisting of massive sulphide stringer-style mineralization approximately 350m further downdip that graded 193% cu178% zn 310 g/t ag over 44m (figure 6) additional drilling will be required this area to define extent of this mineralized horizon relationship of this fault slice with tesla bridge zoneoverall ts-24-34 intersected a 68m interval of main lens massive sulphide at stratigraphic top of tesla zone dominantly consisting of massive pyrite with lesser chalcopyrite sphalerite a strongly chlorite altered host rock which graded 162% copper 484% zinc directly below massive sulphide hole intersected a zone of strong breccia stringer sulphides over 84m which contained significant copper gold mineralization grading 238% copper 189 g/t au this interval speaks to potential that exists at tesla to intersect additional high-grade copper-gold intervals as infill drilling continues this copper-gold intersection was followed by a second broad zone of dominantly stringer-style mineralization over 222m  which graded 130% copper finally ts-24-34 intersected an additional mineralized horizon footwall below tesla this footwall mineralization generally hosted strongly foliated locally brecciated units shows a similar combination of stringer-style mineralization massive sulphide as seen at tesla itself including 17m of massive sulphide grading 437% copper 1547% zinc followed by multiple narrow

also predicted that as much as 90% of teslas enterprise value earnings will be attributed to robotaxi business by 2028-29 this prediction may anticipate a possibility of uber lyft becoming clients or partners rather than rivals musks supercharger network crucial to success of a robotaxi industry us since secretary of transportation pete buttiigieg has basically spent over $1 billion each on just

146,2024-10-24,q3 2024 tesla inc earnings call,thank you so to recap as someone was saying something that what industry was seeing year-over-year declines order volumes q3 tesla at same time has achieved record deliveries fact i think if you look at ev companies worldwide to best of my knowledge no ev company even profitable im not -- to best of my knowledge there was no ev division of any company of any existing car company that profitableso it notable that tesla profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment this quarter actually a record q3 for us so we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday so congratulations to teams that made it happen tesla thats staggering immense amount of work to make 7 million cars so you see we all have -- energy storage business growing like wildfire with strong demand for both megapack powerwalland as you all know on october 10 we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that i think very compelling that tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience future where you have humanoid robots working among craft not with a canned video a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks whatnot we had 50 autonomous vehicles there were 20 cybercabs but there were an additional 30 model ys operating fully autonomously entire night carrying thousands of people with no incidents entire nightand all those who went there that worth emphasizing that cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to whole night went very smoothlyso regarding vehicle business we are still on track to deliver our affordable models starting first half of 2025 this -- i think probably people want should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year at risk of -- to take a bit of risk here i do want to give some rough estimate which i think its 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year notwithstanding negative external events like if theres some force majeure events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that we cant overcome massive force majeure events but i think with our lower-cost vehicles with advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year my best guessand then cybercab reaching volume production 26 i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 just starting production reaching volume production 26 that should be substantial but were aiming for at least 2 million units a year of cybercab that will be more than one factory but i think its at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimatelyso yeah these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses those are my best guesses cell 4680 lines team actually doing great work there 4680 rapidly approaching point where it most competitive cell so when you consider fully landed -- cost of a battery pack fully landed us net of incentives duties 4680 tracking to be most competitive maybe lower cost per kilowatt hour fully considered than any other alternative were not quite there yet but were close to being there which i think extremely exciting weve got several -- a lot of ideas to go well beyond thatso i think theres -- if we execute well 4680 -- well have -- tesla internally produced cell will be most cost competitive cell north america a testament to tremendous amount of hard work there done by team so thats to say well continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors i tend not to -- to provide -- to make cells just internally so i dont want to sort of herewere obviously increasing substantially our vehicle output our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cells most of them will still come from suppliers but i think it some good news that tesla internal cell likely to be most competitive usso with respect to autonomy as people are experiencing cars really from week to week there are significant improvements miles between interventions so with new version 125 release of (inaudible) cybertruck combining code into a single stack so that city driving engine highway driving are one stack which a big improvement for highway driving so its just all neural nets release of actually smart -- we try to have a sense of humor hereand were also -- so thats 125 version 13 of fsd going out soon will elaborate more on that later call we expect to see roughly a five or six-fold improvement miles between interventions compared to 125 actually looking at year as whole improvement miles interventions we think will be at least (inaudible) so thats a very dramatic improvement course of year we expect that trend to continue next yearso current total expectation internal expectation for tesla fsd having longer miles [intervention] human second quarter of next year which means it may end up being third quarter but its next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year ashok do you want toyes miles between critical interventions mentioned by elon already made 100x improvement with 125 from starting of this year then with v13 release we expect to be 1000x from beginning from january of this year on production software this came because of technology improvements going to end-to-end having higher frame rate partly also helped by hardware force more capabilities so on we hope that we continue to scale neural network data training compute et cetera by q2 next year we should cross over average even miles per critical intervention (inaudible) that caseelon muski mean that just unvarnished our internal estimateso thats not sandbagging or anything else our internal estimate q2 of next year to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereaftera vast majority of humanity has no idea that tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a model 3 or model y it looks like a normal car so you dont expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself a cybercab looks different a cybertruck looks different but model y model 3 are -- look theyre good-looking cars but look at fairly normal you dont expect a fairly normal looking car to have intelligence enough ai to be able to drive itself but it doesso we do want to expose that to more people so were doing -- every time we have a significant improvement software well roll out another sort of 30-day trial so to encourage people to try it again we are seeing a significant improvement adoption so take rate for fsd has improved substantially especially after 10/10 eventyes so theres no need to wait for robotaxi or cybercab to experience full autonomy we expect to achieve that next year with our existing vehicle lineashok elluswamyi wanted to actually someone gives a small taste of what its going to look like car able to drive itself to user within private parking lots currently its speed-limited but then its going to quickly be increased we actually have a million usage (inaudible)elon muskyes we actually -- we have for tesla employees bay area we already are offering ridehailing capabilities so you can actually with development app you can request a ride it will take you anywhere bay area we do have a safety driver for now but its not required to do that weve developed i mean david do you want to elaborate on thatdavid lauyes sure its david we showed some screenshots of this q1 shareholder deck this real weve been testing it for good part of year building blocks that we needed order to build this functionality deliver it to production weve been thinking about working on for yearsit just so happens that weve used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers meantime such as sharing your profile synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into whether its another car that you own or a car that somebody has loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into it looks exactly like yours everything synchronized seat mirror positions media navigation everything same just what you would expect from one of our robotaxisbut we gave that functionality to our customers right now because weve built it intending for it to be used future but were releasing that functionality now all end-to-end cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality sending a navigation destination from your phone to vehicle so were doing that now with ridehailing app but its something that weve made available to customers for yearsseeing progress on a route mobile app thats something youll need for ridehailing app but again we released it meantime so its not like were just starting to think about this stuff right now while were building out early stages of our ridehailing network weve been thinking about this for quite a long time were excited to get functionality out thereelon muskyes we do expect to roll out ridehailing california texas next year to public now california somewhere -- theres quite a long regulatory approval process i think we should get approval next year but its contingent upon regulatory approval texas a lot faster so its -- well definitely have available texas probably have it available california subject to regulatory approval maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least california texasso i think that would be very exciting thats really a profound change tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle a battery manufacturing company at that point so we published q3 vehicle safety report which shows one pack for every (inaudible) pilot that compressed us average of crash roughly every 700000 miles so its currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to us average we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate needs of both fsd optimuswe are currently not training compute constrained it probably big limiting factors of fsd actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes when you start getting to where it can take 10000 miles to find a mistake it takes a while to actually figure out which it -- software a better than software b it actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them makes mistakes would take a long time to make mistakes so its actually single biggest limiting factor how long does it take us to figure out which version better that sort of a high-class problemobviously having a giant fleet very helpful for breaking this out then with optimus we showed a mass improvement optimus exterior movement on october 10 our next-gen which 22 degrees freedom which double prior for its extremely human-like so its much better at tactile sensing i feel confident saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot were moreover only company that really has all of ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robotsbecause things that what other companies are missing that theyre missing ai brain that theyre missing people to really scale to very high-volume production so you see some impressive video demos but what like localized ai volume to very high numbers as ive said on a few occasions before i think optimus will ultimately be [most viable] part so i think has a good chance of being most viable product that we madefor energy business thats doing extremely well opportunity ahead lathrop megapack factory reached 200 megapacks a week which now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate we have a second factory shanghai that will begin with 20-gigawatt hour year run rate q1 next year so next quarter that will also scale out it wont be long before were shipping 100 gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at tesla that will ultimately grow i think to multiple terawatt hours per year it has to actually order to have a sustainable energy future if youre not at terawatt scale youre not really moving needleso if you look at our very complicated last master plan which i think actually too much detail ill maybe ask [roan] to analyze it give us tldr on management plan we shared that master plan that it possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation batteries electric transport there were no fundamental material limitations like theres not some very rare material that we dont have enough of we actually have enough with raw materials to take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable dramatically increased its trust usage would still be fully sustainableone way to think of progress of a civilization space a little esoteric but percentage completion of at scale so (inaudible) scale one would be youre using all power of a planet were currently less than 1% on level 1 level 2 would be using all power of sun level 3 all of power of galaxy so weve got a long way to go long way to gowhen you think terms it becomes obvious that by far biggest source of energy sun everything else so concluding tesla focused on building future of energy transport robotics ai this a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends we think what were doing right approach if we execute on our objectives i think we will my prediction tesla will become most valuable company world probably by a long shoti want to thank tesla team once again for strong execution a tough operating environment were looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future thank youtravis axelrodgreat thank you very much elon vaibhav has some opening remarks as wellvaibhav tanejathanks our q3 results were positive once again demonstrate scale to which business has evolved or with generation of record operating cash flows of $63 billion our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter year-on-year while we had unit volume growth we did experience a reduction asps primarily due to impact of financing incentives as a reminder we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks financial institution recognize cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenuewe released fsd for cybertruck other features like actually small [cell] like elon talked about north america which contributed $326 million of revenues quarter we continue to see elevated levels of revenue regulatory sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year to expand on this at an industry level china continues to outperform us europe by a factor of three if there something to be learned from that this gives a signal of what to come other regions as customers acceptance of ev growth we feel that right strategy to build affordable more compelling leadsour focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory to support this strategy were continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options when you compare any vehicle our lineup with other oems we believe our vehicles provide much better value particularly when you consider safety features performance unparalleled software functionalities like david also talked about include also what ashok had talked about around autonomy music options parental controls much morewhile every vehicle our lineup comes up with these capabilities there an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners we plan on making these more visible our interactions with both existing future customers automotive margins improved quarter-over-quarter as a result of a feature release discussed before increase our overall production delivery volume benefit from marketing pricing more localized deliveries region which resulted lower freight increasesustaining these margins q4 however will be challenging given current economic environment note that we are focused on cost per vehicle there are numerous work streams within company to squeeze out cost without compromising on customer experienceelon muskyes im assuming thats a hopefully a helpful macro trend if theres a decline interest rates this has a massive effect on automotive demand because vast majority of people -- demand driven by monthly payment can they afford monthly payment so most likely well see continue to decline interest rates which helps with affordability of vehiclesvaibhav tanejayeah i mean that one trend which we observed industry that because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates people are wanted cars longer especially us that actually having an impact on overall industry tooas we discussed earlier as we discussed back orders energy deployments fluctuate quarter-on-quarter due to customer readiness location of orders being fulfilled not necessarily an indicator of demand of production within quarterwhile we did see a decline q3 we expect to grow deployment sequentially q4 to end year with more than double of last year energy margins q3 were a record at more than 30% this a function of mix of projects being deployed quarter note that there will be fluctuation margins as we manage through deployments our inventory our pipeline backlog continue to grow quarter-over-quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots we are doing our best to keep up with demandjust coming back on automotive margins i talked about what happening one other thing which i want to also share that were seeing that we will continue to keep whatever we can to like i said before about squeezing of cost but this something which we also are very capable of i mean just q3 we faced our lowest cost per vehicle that a trend which we want to keep focused onthen going on to service other we continue to show improvements q3 this was a result of better performance both our service as well as it includes collision part sales merchandise continued growth supercharging these fee-based revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases our operating expenses declined quarter-over-quarter on year-on-year basis this partially due to restructuring we undertook q2 cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase costs related to our ai effortsweve started using gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead of schedule are on track to get 50000 gpus deployed texas by end of this month one thing which id like to elaborate that were being really judicious on our ai compute spend to saying how best we can utilize existing infrastructure before making further investments on capex front we had about $35 billion quarter this was a sequential increase largely because of investments ai compute we now expect our capex for year to be excess of $11 billionwe shared our vision for future at we robot event at beginning of month tesla team hyper-focused on delivering on that vision all efforts are underway to make it a reality while weve achieved significant progress this year it will take time to get this as we find new incredibly complex technologies navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape future incredibly bright i want to thank tesla team once again for all their helpgreat thank you very much vaibhav now well go to investor questions first one is tesla still on track to deliver more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier how does it align with your ai product road maplars moravysure i mean as elon vaibhav both said we are on plan to meet that first half of next year ambition has always been to lower cost of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy transport part of that lowering cost of our current vehicles which where all of personally-owned vehicles that we sell today come but next stage that really as it fits into ai road map well as we bring robotaxis which lowers initial cost of getting into an ev thats really where we see marriage of ev road map ai road mapelon muskyes it will be like with incentive [sub 30000] which kind of a key thresholdtravis axelrodgreat thank you very much similar question next when can we expect tesla to give us $25000 non-robotaxi regular car modelso i think weve made very clear that were -- future autonomous i mean its going to be -- ive actually said this many years ago but that my strong belief i believe that panning out to be true very obvious retrospect that future autonomous electric vehicles non-autonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse using a foot bone its not that there are no horses yeah there are some but theyre unusual theyre nicheand so everything going to be electric autonomous i think this like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that future so a lot of automotive companies most of companies have not internalized this which surprising because were shouting from rooftops for such a long time it will accrue to their detriments future but all of our vehicles future will be autonomousyes so all vehicles that weve really made almost 7 million vehicles vast majority are capable of autonomy were currently making on order of 35000 autonomous vehicles a week to say waymos entire fleet less than -- theyve less than 1000 corners were making 35000 a weekyes they mostly look normal cybertruck looks abnormal cybercab robotaxi we wanted to have something futuristic looking i think it does look futuristicits worth going with respect to cybercab its not -- its especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution vehicle manufacturing that was also coming with cybercab cycle times like units per hour of cybercab line it -- like this just really something special i mean this (inaudible) of than other car manufacturing lines like -- not even same league what im saying not same league i said like several years ago that maybe most -- hottest tesla be battery just like by a factoryyes its like -- so were rapidly evolving our manufacturing technology so anyway basically i think having a regular $25000 model pointless it would be silly like completely at odds with what we believelars moravyin autonomous world what matters lowest cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle thats what weve done with robotaxielon muskexactly its fully considered cost per mile what matters if you try to make a car that essentially a hybrid manual automatic car its not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yes cybercab just not going to have stairwells you design optimize for autonomous it will cost on order of cost roughly $25000 so it a $25000 car you can you will be able to buy one exclusively if you wanttravis axelrodgreat next question what tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centersashok elluswamyso we aim on solving problems at source so at factory before they can even affect our customers we believe best service no service really dont even --dont see what test you get to do to fix issue upstream or you would remotely do through software maybe at work or at home car we park weve addressed fixed issue weve partnered field with service to make sure were looking at same issues additionally just q2 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total of nearly 70 locations north america we significantly expand size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon muskyeah i think it was like actually a lot of merit of having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor you can start your approach yes it should be more factory-like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service its way easier for somebody to become expert a few different types of repairs than every repairashok elluswamyexactly this has helped us with base that heavy repairs like dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through really treating it like a factoryelon muskyeah this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got a good feedback with our carsashok elluswamyyes with factory with service leaders together its sent people from factors that feel you feel for factory to see it firsthand by suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon muskyes so i view this as a structural -- a fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industrymust do a bunch of work on software side to omni diagnostics identifying what needs to be done to before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car be very efficiently worked on once it arrivescertain parts are there like (multiple speakers)elon muskthis whats wrong me tells service centre -- please fix me this what wronginstead a customer trying to translate car telling us directly were pulling thatelon muskyes most time you dont need to diagnose car when it arrives car -- this like again a fundamental technology advantage structural advantage compared to rest of auto industryvaibhav tanejai think its underappreciated as to what all we are able to do thats why -- because like i said before most of our cars except for cybertruck look same so people dont realize that it has so much capabilityelon muskbetter than other cars but theyre not like obviously super futuristictravis axelrodgreat thanks very much next question please provide an update on semi what will next stage growth look like when will readylars moravysure so as you -- we posted an earnings were progressing something on build of semi factory our data factory reno weve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program were on track to start pilot builds second half of next year with production starting first half of 2026 ramping really throughout year to full production semi growth will largely depend on our customers adoption of productyes what a which like semi because its really a commodity of total cost of --elon muskyes exactly we have kind of ridiculous demand for semilars moravyin that where its about how much do i spend to testing per mile its a no-brainerelon muskyeah fundamentally if youve got a semi fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport better than a diesel truck any company that doesnt adopt an electric semi will lose its not a subjective thing its like whether you like competitive we want stat we want to have a good old semi truck but frankly if we made an would it matterlars moravyand this proving so our fleets pespsi partner fact pepsi you actually said last week that their drivers dont want to go backelon muskas soon as we gave anyone at electric semi thats like choiceyes yes thats like -- so more senior like theyre top drivers well they get to drive a tesla semi its thing they want to drive its super fun to drivewell but i mean like youve seen like videos that were like like some like can you uphill here as speeding fast like diesel truck yeah cars so like its responsive you floor it truck actuallylars moravyand thats a benefit only for driver for goods but also for safety terms of other drivers on road you dont get stuck behind semi youre not like a slowdown situation i mean how that plays into fsd which second part of question all of this have been a couple of hundred weve deployed already ones that well be building next year throughout future how all of hardware camera necessary to deploy fsd were currently training with that small we have as soon as fleet trained neural that there up well get fsd onto that platformelon muskyeah i mean there would be a mass improvement driver fatigue because driver safety weve got sort of anti-jack knifing software you dont have to worry about your brakes overheating if you go down a steep hill because we generating that energy goes back into pack (multiple speakers) its like radically better than a diesel what drivers love ittravis axelrodgreat guys thanks very much our next question when will tesla incorporate x grok all tesla vehicleselon muski mean these are relatively small things but yes i think well keep expanding what available car on screen also improving like browser so like just generally you can access anything you want car fact for tesla once you get to full autonomy you actually want fully a system that -- can do anythinglike if you want to browse internet if you want to ask ai questions if you want to watch a movie if you want to play a video game if you wanted to do some productivity thing you can do anything you want an autonomous vehicle because you dont need to drive so thats why cybercabs got a nice big screen a great sound system so you can watch it watch youre moving with its like being a personal movie theater [dawson]yes this why weve been building this functionality i think gaming to car adding other -- all sorts of different media applications of car because thats what youre going to -- thats yes cars that will be built todayelon muskfun games by way people havent tried it theres like castle polatopia a bunch of really fun games carwere constantly looking at what features to add next were paying attention to whats most commonly requested by our customersgreat next question elon mentioned unsupervised fsd california texas next year does that mean regulators have agreed to it

one of major obstacles to teslas entry into autonomous driving field let alone dominance regulatory obstacles although tesla has driving testing permits that allows it to test autonomous technology with a safety driver on public roads it does not have driverless testing permits nor have they even applied for such permits according to techcrunch quoting a public information officer from california dmv waymo has obtained regulatory approval operates a level 4 driving system several cities there are also federal regulatory requirements as techcrunch noted a recent article if tesla wants to mass produce its robotaxis with no traditional driver controls it needs to obtain an exemption from federal motor vehicle safety standards that nhtsa has confirmed that tesla has not applied for such an exemption which will likely not be easy to obtain2 its competitors are way ahead -

robotics work was tesla bot dubbed optimus musks enthusiasm for potential of optimus enormous he stated q2 2024 report some of following commentsi think long-term value of optimus will exceed that of everything else that tesla combinedi suspect that long-term demand for general-purpose humanoid robots excess of 20 billion units tesla -- that has most advanced humanoid robot world also very good at manufacturing which these other companies are notmy rough estimate long-term market cap on order of $5 trillion for -- maybe more for autonomous transport its several times that number for general purpose humanoid robotsits a wild -- very wild future were heading forthe projected commercialization launch of optimus will likely be 1 of 2 major breakthroughs for tesla 2027 other will be a push towards an official full-scale robotaxi production distribution ark invests cathie woods believes it will start 2025 but regulatory obstacles will likely not allow it to fully launch until 2027 as a result eps expected to jump almost 50% a projected price of $39360 would be a +129 point gain2028-29cathie woods also predicted that as much as 90% of teslas enterprise value earnings will be attributed to robotaxi business by 2028-29 this prediction may anticipate a possibility of uber lyft becoming clients or partners rather than rivals musks supercharger network crucial to success of a robotaxi industry us since secretary of transportation pete buttiigieg has basically spent over $1 billion each on just (7) dot-built recharging stations to date this a huge strategic leverage that

152,2024-10-24,q3 2024 tesla inc earnings call,thank you so to recap as someone was saying something that what industry was seeing year-over-year declines order volumes q3 tesla at same time has achieved record deliveries fact i think if you look at ev companies worldwide to best of my knowledge no ev company even profitable im not -- to best of my knowledge there was no ev division of any company of any existing car company that profitableso it notable that tesla profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment this quarter actually a record q3 for us so we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday so congratulations to teams that made it happen tesla thats staggering immense amount of work to make 7 million cars so you see we all have -- energy storage business growing like wildfire with strong demand for both megapack powerwalland as you all know on october 10 we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that i think very compelling that tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience future where you have humanoid robots working among craft not with a canned video a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks whatnot we had 50 autonomous vehicles there were 20 cybercabs but there were an additional 30 model ys operating fully autonomously entire night carrying thousands of people with no incidents entire nightand all those who went there that worth emphasizing that cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to whole night went very smoothlyso regarding vehicle business we are still on track to deliver our affordable models starting first half of 2025 this -- i think probably people want should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year at risk of -- to take a bit of risk here i do want to give some rough estimate which i think its 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year notwithstanding negative external events like if theres some force majeure events like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that we cant overcome massive force majeure events but i think with our lower-cost vehicles with advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year my best guessand then cybercab reaching volume production 26 i do feel confident of cybercab reaching volume production 26 just starting production reaching volume production 26 that should be substantial but were aiming for at least 2 million units a year of cybercab that will be more than one factory but i think its at least 2 million units a year maybe 4 million ultimatelyso yeah these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses those are my best guesses cell 4680 lines team actually doing great work there 4680 rapidly approaching point where it most competitive cell so when you consider fully landed -- cost of a battery pack fully landed us net of incentives duties 4680 tracking to be most competitive maybe lower cost per kilowatt hour fully considered than any other alternative were not quite there yet but were close to being there which i think extremely exciting weve got several -- a lot of ideas to go well beyond thatso i think theres -- if we execute well 4680 -- well have -- tesla internally produced cell will be most cost competitive cell north america a testament to tremendous amount of hard work there done by team so thats to say well continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors i tend not to -- to provide -- to make cells just internally so i dont want to sort of herewere obviously increasing substantially our vehicle output our stationary storage output so we need a lot of cells most of them will still come from suppliers but i think it some good news that tesla internal cell likely to be most competitive usso with respect to autonomy as people are experiencing cars really from week to week there are significant improvements miles between interventions so with new version 125 release of (inaudible) cybertruck combining code into a single stack so that city driving engine highway driving are one stack which a big improvement for highway driving so its just all neural nets release of actually smart -- we try to have a sense of humor hereand were also -- so thats 125 version 13 of fsd going out soon will elaborate more on that later call we expect to see roughly a five or six-fold improvement miles between interventions compared to 125 actually looking at year as whole improvement miles interventions we think will be at least (inaudible) so thats a very dramatic improvement course of year we expect that trend to continue next yearso current total expectation internal expectation for tesla fsd having longer miles [intervention] human second quarter of next year which means it may end up being third quarter but its next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year ashok do you want toyes miles between critical interventions mentioned by elon already made 100x improvement with 125 from starting of this year then with v13 release we expect to be 1000x from beginning from january of this year on production software this came because of technology improvements going to end-to-end having higher frame rate partly also helped by hardware force more capabilities so on we hope that we continue to scale neural network data training compute et cetera by q2 next year we should cross over average even miles per critical intervention (inaudible) that caseelon muski mean that just unvarnished our internal estimateso thats not sandbagging or anything else our internal estimate q2 of next year to be safer than human then to continue with rapid improvements thereaftera vast majority of humanity has no idea that tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a model 3 or model y it looks like a normal car so you dont expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself a cybercab looks different a cybertruck looks different but model y model 3 are -- look theyre good-looking cars but look at fairly normal you dont expect a fairly normal looking car to have intelligence enough ai to be able to drive itself but it doesso we do want to expose that to more people so were doing -- every time we have a significant improvement software well roll out another sort of 30-day trial so to encourage people to try it again we are seeing a significant improvement adoption so take rate for fsd has improved substantially especially after 10/10 eventyes so theres no need to wait for robotaxi or cybercab to experience full autonomy we expect to achieve that next year with our existing vehicle lineashok elluswamyi wanted to actually someone gives a small taste of what its going to look like car able to drive itself to user within private parking lots currently its speed-limited but then its going to quickly be increased we actually have a million usage (inaudible)elon muskyes we actually -- we have for tesla employees bay area we already are offering ridehailing capabilities so you can actually with development app you can request a ride it will take you anywhere bay area we do have a safety driver for now but its not required to do that weve developed i mean david do you want to elaborate on thatdavid lauyes sure its david we showed some screenshots of this q1 shareholder deck this real weve been testing it for good part of year building blocks that we needed order to build this functionality deliver it to production weve been thinking about working on for yearsit just so happens that weve used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers meantime such as sharing your profile synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into whether its another car that you own or a car that somebody has loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into it looks exactly like yours everything synchronized seat mirror positions media navigation everything same just what you would expect from one of our robotaxisbut we gave that functionality to our customers right now because weve built it intending for it to be used future but were releasing that functionality now all end-to-end cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality sending a navigation destination from your phone to vehicle so were doing that now with ridehailing app but its something that weve made available to customers for yearsseeing progress on a route mobile app thats something youll need for ridehailing app but again we released it meantime so its not like were just starting to think about this stuff right now while were building out early stages of our ridehailing network weve been thinking about this for quite a long time were excited to get functionality out thereelon muskyes we do expect to roll out ridehailing california texas next year to public now california somewhere -- theres quite a long regulatory approval process i think we should get approval next year but its contingent upon regulatory approval texas a lot faster so its -- well definitely have available texas probably have it available california subject to regulatory approval maybe some other states actually next year as well but at least california texasso i think that would be very exciting thats really a profound change tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle a battery manufacturing company at that point so we published q3 vehicle safety report which shows one pack for every (inaudible) pilot that compressed us average of crash roughly every 700000 miles so its currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to us average we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate needs of both fsd optimuswe are currently not training compute constrained it probably big limiting factors of fsd actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes when you start getting to where it can take 10000 miles to find a mistake it takes a while to actually figure out which it -- software a better than software b it actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them makes mistakes would take a long time to make mistakes so its actually single biggest limiting factor how long does it take us to figure out which version better that sort of a high-class problemobviously having a giant fleet very helpful for breaking this out then with optimus we showed a mass improvement optimus exterior movement on october 10 our next-gen which 22 degrees freedom which double prior for its extremely human-like so its much better at tactile sensing i feel confident saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot were moreover only company that really has all of ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robotsbecause things that what other companies are missing that theyre missing ai brain that theyre missing people to really scale to very high-volume production so you see some impressive video demos but what like localized ai volume to very high numbers as ive said on a few occasions before i think optimus will ultimately be [most viable] part so i think has a good chance of being most viable product that we madefor energy business thats doing extremely well opportunity ahead lathrop megapack factory reached 200 megapacks a week which now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate we have a second factory shanghai that will begin with 20-gigawatt hour year run rate q1 next year so next quarter that will also scale out it wont be long before were shipping 100 gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at tesla that will ultimately grow i think to multiple terawatt hours per year it has to actually order to have a sustainable energy future if youre not at terawatt scale youre not really moving needleso if you look at our very complicated last master plan which i think actually too much detail ill maybe ask [roan] to analyze it give us tldr on management plan we shared that master plan that it possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy power generation batteries electric transport there were no fundamental material limitations like theres not some very rare material that we dont have enough of we actually have enough with raw materials to take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable dramatically increased its trust usage would still be fully sustainableone way to think of progress of a civilization space a little esoteric but percentage completion of at scale so (inaudible) scale one would be youre using all power of a planet were currently less than 1% on level 1 level 2 would be using all power of sun level 3 all of power of galaxy so weve got a long way to go long way to gowhen you think terms it becomes obvious that by far biggest source of energy sun everything else so concluding tesla focused on building future of energy transport robotics ai this a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends we think what were doing right approach if we execute on our objectives i think we will my prediction tesla will become most valuable company world probably by a long shoti want to thank tesla team once again for strong execution a tough operating environment were looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future thank youtravis axelrodgreat thank you very much elon vaibhav has some opening remarks as wellvaibhav tanejathanks our q3 results were positive once again demonstrate scale to which business has evolved or with generation of record operating cash flows of $63 billion our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter year-on-year while we had unit volume growth we did experience a reduction asps primarily due to impact of financing incentives as a reminder we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks financial institution recognize cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenuewe released fsd for cybertruck other features like actually small [cell] like elon talked about north america which contributed $326 million of revenues quarter we continue to see elevated levels of revenue regulatory sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year to expand on this at an industry level china continues to outperform us europe by a factor of three if there something to be learned from that this gives a signal of what to come other regions as customers acceptance of ev growth we feel that right strategy to build affordable more compelling leadsour focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory to support this strategy were continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options when you compare any vehicle our lineup with other oems we believe our vehicles provide much better value particularly when you consider safety features performance unparalleled software functionalities like david also talked about include also what ashok had talked about around autonomy music options parental controls much morewhile every vehicle our lineup comes up with these capabilities there an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners we plan on making these more visible our interactions with both existing future customers automotive margins improved quarter-over-quarter as a result of a feature release discussed before increase our overall production delivery volume benefit from marketing pricing more localized deliveries region which resulted lower freight increasesustaining these margins q4 however will be challenging given current economic environment note that we are focused on cost per vehicle there are numerous work streams within company to squeeze out cost without compromising on customer experienceelon muskyes im assuming thats a hopefully a helpful macro trend if theres a decline interest rates this has a massive effect on automotive demand because vast majority of people -- demand driven by monthly payment can they afford monthly payment so most likely well see continue to decline interest rates which helps with affordability of vehiclesvaibhav tanejayeah i mean that one trend which we observed industry that because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates people are wanted cars longer especially us that actually having an impact on overall industry tooas we discussed earlier as we discussed back orders energy deployments fluctuate quarter-on-quarter due to customer readiness location of orders being fulfilled not necessarily an indicator of demand of production within quarterwhile we did see a decline q3 we expect to grow deployment sequentially q4 to end year with more than double of last year energy margins q3 were a record at more than 30% this a function of mix of projects being deployed quarter note that there will be fluctuation margins as we manage through deployments our inventory our pipeline backlog continue to grow quarter-over-quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots we are doing our best to keep up with demandjust coming back on automotive margins i talked about what happening one other thing which i want to also share that were seeing that we will continue to keep whatever we can to like i said before about squeezing of cost but this something which we also are very capable of i mean just q3 we faced our lowest cost per vehicle that a trend which we want to keep focused onthen going on to service other we continue to show improvements q3 this was a result of better performance both our service as well as it includes collision part sales merchandise continued growth supercharging these fee-based revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases our operating expenses declined quarter-over-quarter on year-on-year basis this partially due to restructuring we undertook q2 cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase costs related to our ai effortsweve started using gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead of schedule are on track to get 50000 gpus deployed texas by end of this month one thing which id like to elaborate that were being really judicious on our ai compute spend to saying how best we can utilize existing infrastructure before making further investments on capex front we had about $35 billion quarter this was a sequential increase largely because of investments ai compute we now expect our capex for year to be excess of $11 billionwe shared our vision for future at we robot event at beginning of month tesla team hyper-focused on delivering on that vision all efforts are underway to make it a reality while weve achieved significant progress this year it will take time to get this as we find new incredibly complex technologies navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape future incredibly bright i want to thank tesla team once again for all their helptravis axelrodgreat thank you very much vaibhav now well go to investor questions first one is tesla still on track to deliver more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier how does it align with your ai product road maplars moravysure i mean as elon vaibhav both said we are on plan to meet that first half of next year ambition has always been to lower cost of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy transport part of that lowering cost of our current vehicles which where all of personally-owned vehicles that we sell today come but next stage that really as it fits into ai road map well as we bring robotaxis which lowers initial cost of getting into an ev thats really where we see marriage of ev road map ai road mapelon muskyes it will be like with incentive [sub 30000] which kind of a key thresholdtravis axelrodgreat thank you very much similar question next when can we expect tesla to give us $25000 non-robotaxi regular car modelso i think weve made very clear that were -- future autonomous i mean its going to be -- ive actually said this many years ago but that my strong belief i believe that panning out to be true very obvious retrospect that future autonomous electric vehicles non-autonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse using a foot bone its not that there are no horses yeah there are some but theyre unusual theyre nicheand so everything going to be electric autonomous i think this like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that future so a lot of automotive companies most of companies have not internalized this which surprising because were shouting from rooftops for such a long time it will accrue to their detriments future but all of our vehicles future will be autonomousyes so all vehicles that weve really made almost 7 million vehicles vast majority are capable of autonomy were currently making on order of 35000 autonomous vehicles a week to say waymos entire fleet less than -- theyve less than 1000 corners were making 35000 a weekyes they mostly look normal cybertruck looks abnormal cybercab robotaxi we wanted to have something futuristic looking i think it does look futuristicits worth going with respect to cybercab its not -- its especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution vehicle manufacturing that was also coming with cybercab cycle times like units per hour of cybercab line it -- like this just really something special i mean this (inaudible) of than other car manufacturing lines like -- not even same league what im saying not same league i said like several years ago that maybe most -- hottest tesla be battery just like by a factoryyes its like -- so were rapidly evolving our manufacturing technology so anyway basically i think having a regular $25000 model pointless it would be silly like completely at odds with what we believelars moravyin autonomous world what matters lowest cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle thats what weve done with robotaxielon muskexactly its fully considered cost per mile what matters if you try to make a car that essentially a hybrid manual automatic car its not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yes cybercab just not going to have stairwells you design optimize for autonomous it will cost on order of cost roughly $25000 so it a $25000 car you can you will be able to buy one exclusively if you wanttravis axelrodgreat next question what tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centersashok elluswamyso we aim on solving problems at source so at factory before they can even affect our customers we believe best service no service really dont even --dont see what test you get to do to fix issue upstream or you would remotely do through software maybe at work or at home car we park weve addressed fixed issue weve partnered field with service to make sure were looking at same issues additionally just q2 q4 of this year alone we have opened will open total of nearly 70 locations north america we significantly expand size of each location have doubled size last year compared to this yearelon muskyeah i think it was like actually a lot of merit of having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor you can start your approach yes it should be more factory-like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service its way easier for somebody to become expert a few different types of repairs than every repairashok elluswamyexactly this has helped us with base that heavy repairs like dedicated lanes for different type of repairs so its through really treating it like a factoryelon muskyeah this where a tesla structure i think a strong advantage relative to rest of auto industry because we make cars we service cars whereas i think theres a bit of a conflict of interest with dealer model traditional oem dealer model where dealerships make most of their money on service so they dont -- they obviously assistance to reduce servicing cost whereas our case we are incented to reduce service cost because we carry that servicing cost weve got a good feedback with our carsashok elluswamyyes with factory with service leaders together its sent people from factors that feel you feel for factory to see it firsthand by suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on designelon muskyes so i view this as a structural -- a fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus rest of auto industrymust do a bunch of work on software side to omni diagnostics identifying what needs to be done to before it comes into service but also automating all of preparation work aligning all resources that are necessary order for car be very efficiently worked on once it arrivescertain parts are there like (multiple speakers)elon muskthis whats wrong me tells service centre -- please fix me this what wronginstead a customer trying to translate car telling us directly were pulling thatelon muskyes most time you dont need to diagnose car when it arrives car -- this like again a fundamental technology advantage structural advantage compared to rest of auto industryvaibhav tanejai think its underappreciated as to what all we are able to do thats why -- because like i said before most of our cars except for cybertruck look same so people dont realize that it has so much capabilityelon muskbetter than other cars but theyre not like obviously super futuristictravis axelrodgreat thanks very much next question please provide an update on semi what will next stage growth look like when will readylars moravysure so as you -- we posted an earnings were progressing something on build of semi factory our data factory reno weve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program were on track to start pilot builds second half of next year with production starting first half of 2026 ramping really throughout year to full production semi growth will largely depend on our customers adoption of productyes what a which like semi because its really a commodity of total cost of --elon muskyes exactly we have kind of ridiculous demand for semilars moravyin that where its about how much do i spend to testing per mile its a no-brainerelon muskyeah fundamentally if youve got a semi fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport better than a diesel truck any company that doesnt adopt an electric semi will lose its not a subjective thing its like whether you like competitive we want stat we want to have a good old semi truck but frankly if we made an would it matterlars moravyand this proving so our fleets pespsi partner fact pepsi you actually said last week that their drivers dont want to go backelon muskas soon as we gave anyone at electric semi thats like choiceyes yes thats like -- so more senior like theyre top drivers well they get to drive a tesla semi its thing they want to drive its super fun to drivewell but i mean like youve seen like videos that were like like some like can you uphill here as speeding fast like diesel truck yeah cars so like its responsive you floor it truck actuallylars moravyand thats a benefit only for driver for goods but also for safety terms of other drivers on road you dont get stuck behind semi youre not like a slowdown situation i mean how that plays into fsd which second part of question all of this have been a couple of hundred weve deployed already ones that well be building next year throughout future how all of hardware camera necessary to deploy fsd were currently training with that small we have as soon as fleet trained neural that there up well get fsd onto that platformelon muskyeah i mean there would be a mass improvement driver fatigue because driver safety weve got sort of anti-jack knifing software you dont have to worry about your brakes overheating if you go down a steep hill because we generating that energy goes back into pack (multiple speakers) its like radically better than a diesel what drivers love ittravis axelrodgreat guys thanks very much our next question when will tesla incorporate x grok all tesla vehicleselon muski mean these are relatively small things but yes i think well keep expanding what available car on screen also improving like browser so like just generally you can access anything you want car fact for tesla once you get to full autonomy you actually want fully a system that -- can do anythinglike if you want to browse internet if you want to ask ai questions if you want to watch a movie if you want to play a video game if you wanted to do some productivity thing you can do anything you want an autonomous vehicle because you dont need to drive so thats why cybercabs got a nice big screen a great sound system so you can watch it watch youre moving with its like being a personal movie theater [dawson]yes this why weve been building this functionality i think gaming to car adding other -- all sorts of different media applications of car because thats what youre going to -- thats yes cars that will be built todayelon muskfun games by way people havent tried it theres like castle polatopia a bunch of really fun games carwere constantly looking at what features to add next were paying

which largely driven by storage solutions - could get a nice boost how that trump has been a big proponent of tax cuts particularly for us-based manufacturers this could benefit tesla which produces a bulk of its energy storage systems batteries domestically at this juncture renewables adoption all about reducing costs building scale this exactly what could happenthere could also be more favorable regulations to speed up renewable energy projects while demand could also increase if infrastructure investments pick up energy policy focusing on grid modernization ramps up tesla could be biggest beneficiary of this as it has a competitive edge energy density cost software integration for its batteries its significant investment manufacturing capacity strengthens its position even without government support teslas energy business should be able to capitalize on growing renewable energy market a closer look at teslas fast-growing clean energy businessless red tape for ai & futuristic projectsadditionally regulations that encourage growth of ai autonomous vehicle technology may be shaped to teslas advantage trumps focus on deregulation may reduce red tape around autonomous vehicle testing deployment accelerating teslas development of full self-driving technology teslas fsd users have already logged over 13 billion cumulative miles a crucial metric for autonomous vehicles as more miles provide valuable data to improve machine learning algorithms with fewer regulatory hurdles tesla could speed up rollout of its self-driving features solidifying its leadership autonomous vehicle market over last few years tesla autopilot accidents have triggered investigations by nhtsa with lapses autopilot judgment identified while these remain serious issues that must be addressed trumps policies could help tesla speed up improvements fsd technologythe math behind a ~$1000 tesla stocklets get down to numbers on how tesla stock can rise over 3x from its current levels revenues could pick up from levels around $120 billion 2025 to about $400 billion by 2029 driven by potentially higher ev shipments entries into new international markets stronger renewable energy sales thats a growth rate of about 35% per year roughly line with companys average growth rate between years 2018 2023while teslas net margins stood at a peak of about 15% 2023 there a real possibility that they could rise further to say about 25% how tax breaks more software sales better manufacturing efficiency economies of scale if that pans out tesla could rake about $100 billion net profits now teslas current p/e multiple stands at about 75x based on projected 2025 earnings wednesdays pre-market stock price of $280 per share if we assume that multiple shrinks to a more modest 30x by 2029 this could translate into a market cap of about $3 trillion for tesla assuming a share count of about 32 billion that implies a stock price of more than $930 per sharewhile investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by us economy following rate cuts how bad can things get if there another recession our dashboard how low can stocks go during a market crash captures how key stocks fared during after last six market crashes,0.103353,positive

170,2024-10-24,elon musk affirme que le service de robotaxi de tesla est test par les employs sur les routes de san francisco depuis prs dun an il promet un full self-driving  non supervis  dici 2025 pour le cybercab,tesla teste depuis quelques mois un service de robot-taxi dans la rgion de la baie de san francisco a dclar elon musk lors de la confrence tlphonique sur les rsultats de lentreprise mercredi  nous pensons que des tesla sans conducteur pourront effectuer des trajets payants lanne prochaine  a dclar musk il a prcis que tesla offrait actuellement un service de covoiturage bas sur un prototype de lapplication aux employs de la rgion de la baie de san francisco les vhicules arrivent avec des conducteurs de scurit au volant pr¦ts ÿ intervenir en cas de problmedes semaines aprs que les investisseurs ont critiqu tesla pour avoir organis un vnement sur les robotaxis qui ne contenait que peu de dtails les dirigeants de tesla ont divulgu mercredi des informations sur le service de transport autonome prvu notamment en rvlant que lentreprise testait djÿ le service avec ses employs dans la rgion de san francisco pour les employs de tesla dans la rgion de la baie nous offrons djÿ une capacit de transport autonome  a dclar musk lors de la confrence tlphonique sur les rsultats du troisime trimestre de lentreprise mercredi  avec lapplication de dveloppement vous pouvez demander une course et elle vous emmnera nimporte o dans la rgion de la baie  a-t-il ajout prcisant que ces courses dessai pour les employs comprenaient des conducteurs de scuritjusquÿ prsent le public na obtenu que peu de dtails sur ce quimpliquerait exactement le service de robotaxi de tesla depuis cinq ans que musk en parle alors que les voitures autonomes exploites par le concurrent waymo circulent dans les rues conduisant des passagers payants dans plusieurs villes les plans de robotaxi de tesla sont encore en cours dlaboration il y a deux semaines lors de lvnement de lancement du robotaxi tant attendu musk na pas donn beaucoup de dtails sur le calendrier ou m¦me sur le fait que tesla prvoyait de grer le service lui-m¦memercredi musk et dautres dirigeants ont communiqu des chances aux investisseurs y compris le fait que tesla prvoit de commencer ÿ effectuer des trajets payants dans le courant de lanne prochaine en californie et au texas nous pensons que nous serons en mesure davoir des teslas sans conducteur effectuant des trajets payants dans le courant de lanne prochaine  a dclar musk lors de lappel sa dclaration reprend et dveloppe un engagement quil avait pris lors de la prsentation du robotaxi de tesla il y a deux semaines lorsquil avait dclar quil prvoyait de mettre en place une conduite autonome  non supervise  dans certains vhicules tesla en 2025 labsence de plan daffaires autour du robotaxi lors de cet vnement a fait plonger laction de lentreprise de plus de 9%mercredi tesla a toutefois regagn la confiance des investisseurs en prvoyant une augmentation des ventes de vhicules lanne prochaineaprs les tests avec les employs les tests payants avec le publiccomme musk la rvl prcdemment tesla va donc commencer le service en utilisant des modles tesla existants et passera ensuite au  cybercab  - une voiture autonome dore ÿ deux places sans volant ni pdales que tesla a dvoile lors de son vnement de ce mois-ci musk a dclar que tesla visait ÿ produire entre 2 et 4 millions de cybercabs chaque anne  il ne sagit que de mes meilleures suppositions  a dclar musk lors de la confrence tlphonique sur les rsultats qui sest tenue mercredi musk qui a reconnu quil pouvait ¦tre optimiste quant ÿ ses dlais a galement dclar quil prvoyait de lancer le service de covoiturage en californie et au texas avant de ltendre ÿ dautres tats il a prcis que lobtention de lautorisation rglementaire en californie pourrait ajouter une certaine incertitude au calendrierseth goldstein un analyste de morningstar qui couvre la socit a dclar quil pensait que tesla pourrait dployer un service de robotaxi payant  ÿ petite chelle  lanne prochaine mais quil doutait que ce soit ÿ grande chelle  elon musk a lanc des calendriers optimistes que nous avons vu ¦tre retards plusieurs fois et de plusieurs annes avant dobtenir un produit tangible sur la route  a-t-il dclar ajoutant   mais avec tesla cest difficile ÿ dire rien nest impossible le cur du projet un full self-driving qui deviendrait  non supervis  dici lanne prochainemusk a dclar que les vhicules fonctionnaient de manire autonome en utilisant la dernire version du logiciel full self-driving de lentreprise qui selon lui sera  1000 fois mieux  que la conduite humaine dici le deuxime trimestre de 2025 il a galement dclar quil prvoyait de lancer un service payant de covoiturage en californie et au texas ÿ partir de lanne prochaine sous rserve de lapprobation des autorits rglementairestesla nest actuellement pas autoris ÿ exploiter un service commercial de covoiturage autonome en californie musk a prdit quil serait plus facile dobtenir une autorisation au texas quen californiecertes litration actuelle de la fsd est un systme daide ÿ la conduite de niveau 2 qui nest pas autonome et ncessite une supervision humaine constante musk a promis que la fsd deviendrait  non supervise  lanne prochaine mais ses prdictions passes en matire dautonomie ne se sont gnralement pas concrtisesnanmoins le fait que tesla ait test sa fonction de covoiturage avec ses employs prouve que lentreprise est toujours dtermine ÿ lancer le rseau tesla network promis depuis longtemps annonc pour la premire fois dans le master plan part deux de musk le tesla network prtend permettre aux propritaires de tesla denvoyer leurs vhicules de manire autonome pour servir de robotaxis pendant que leurs propritaires restent ÿ la maison il sagit vraiment dun changement profond  a dclar musk  tesla deviendra alors plus quune entreprise de fabrication de vhicules et de batteries lors de la confrence tlphonique sur les rsultats les dirigeants de tesla ont dcrit certaines fonctions de lapplication tesla actuelle comme le partage de profils et la synchronisation des rglages entre diffrents vhicules comme jetant les bases dun ventuel service de robot-taxiau dbut de lanne lentreprise a prsent plusieurs captures dcran dune fonction de covoiturage dans son application le premier cran montre un gros bouton qui dit  summon  avec un message plus bas pour le temps dattente possible lcran suivant prsente une carte en 3d avec un petit vhicule virtuel qui suit un itinraire jusquau passager en attente cela ressemble beaucoup ÿ lapplication uber mais en plus teslales dfis et proccupationsderrire cet enthousiasme se cachent plusieurs proccupations lune des principales questions est celle de la scurit bien que la technologie autonome de tesla soit ÿ la pointe elle nest pas exempte de critiques plusieurs incidents impliquant des vhicules en mode autopilot et full self-driving ont t

prsidentielle amricaine qui promet de faire reculer les progrs en matire denvironnement est un dilemme pour tesla dont les principaux acheteurs sidentifient ÿ au camp dmocrate soucieux du

tlphonique sur les rsultats du troisime trimestre de tesla les bnfices suprieurs aux prvisions ont fait grimper laction en flche effaant une chute qui avait dur une bonne partie de lanne rpondant aux questions des fans de tesla et des analystes le pdg milliardaire sest montr nettement plus impassible que lors de ses apparitions spasmodiques au cours de la campagne lectorale pas une seule fois au cours des 72 minutes qua dur lappel le dirigeant de tesla ne sest vu poser la question la plus vidente  doit-il prendre publiquement des positions fermes sur la politique et les questions sociales qui sont en dsaccord avec les principaux acheteurs de tesla qui sidentifient en grande partie avec les ides du camp dmocrate  les voitures tesla sont les meilleures elles ont donc toujours cet avantage mais avec le temps il deviendra plus difficile pour tesla dattirer de nouveaux clients en raison des positions politiques de son pdg  a dclar ross gerber investisseur de longue date et ancien fan delon musk pdg de gerber kawasaki socit de gestion de patrimoine base ÿ los angeles qui dtient toujours une participation de 52 millions de dollars dans tesla  la plupart des pdg se tiennent intelligemment ÿ lcart de la politique pour de bonnes raisons elon ne se soucie pas de la faon dont son soutien ÿ la droite - ironiquement anti-environnementale - nuit ÿ tesla 31 % des acheteurs de

consommateurs confirment ces propos par exemple 46 % des personnes ÿ la recherche dun vhicule lectrique ou hybride rechargeable sidentifient comme proches du parti dmocrate alors que seulement 21 % et 25 % des acheteurs de ces vhicules se disent rpublicains selon les donnes de strategic vision une socit de recherche base ÿ san diego qui interroge des dizaines de milliers de consommateurs chaque semaine linstitut de recherche automobile edmunds a constat dans son enqu¦te la plus rcente que 31 % des acheteurs de voitures affirment quils sont maintenant moins susceptibles denvisager lachat dune tesla comme prochain vhicule spcifiquement ÿ cause des positions delon musk le comportement delon musk a fait fuir les dmocrates et ÿ certains moments labandon du parti dmocrate pour tesla a t significatif  a dclar alexander edwards pdg de strategic vision ÿ forbes ajoutant que tesla na pas non plus fait grand-chose pour stimuler les ventes de vhicules lectriques auprs des lecteurs rpublicains  par consquent on observe une baisse substantielle de la volont dacheter une tesla ÿ lavenir ce pari politique intervient ÿ un moment dlicat pour tesla bien que la socit ait russi ÿ augmenter ses ventes au troisime trimestre le volume des ventes mondiales de la marque est en baisse de 23 % depuis le dbut de lanne aux tats-unis les ventes de tesla depuis le dbut de lanne jusquen septembre sont en baisse de 45 % alors que les ventes globales de vhicules lectriques sont en hausse de 87 % selon cox automotive en californie un tat trs dmocrate qui a t la clef du succs de tesla depuis sa cration et qui reste son principal march aux tats-unis les ventes de tesla ont baiss denviron 13 % cette anneles grandes entreprises publiques et leurs pdg aux tats-unis en particulier celles qui vendent des produits au grand public vitent gnralement de se montrer ouvertement partisanes pour ne pas saliner des clients potentiels ladhsion delon musk ÿ donald trump a fait de tesla une exception et il est clair que le conseil dadministration de la socit nest pas enclin du moins pas publiquement ÿ fixer des limites ÿ ses commentaires publics qui sont souvent source de discorde ni tesla ni la prsidente robyn denholm nont rpondu ÿ un courriel demandant si elle et les autres membres du conseil dadministration avaient discut avec elon musk des implications de ses efforts dans la campagne de donald trumples positions franches delon musk sur les questions sociales en particulier son hostilit rcente aux politiques de diversit dquit et dinclusion (dei) des entreprises ont conduit le california public employees retirement system (calpers) qui dtient des actions tesla dune valeur denviron 18 milliard de dollars ÿ rexaminer son investissement dans le constructeur automobile cette dcision a t prise ÿ la suite dune lettre adresse en octobre ÿ malia cohen contrleuse de ltat de californie par deux organisations de dfense des droits civils demandant au plus grand fonds de pension

lintention de revenir sur les initiatives en matire dnergie propre lances par linflation reduction act souhaite quelon musk joue un rle de conseiller sil est lu les prvisionnistes de lindustrie automobile ne savent pas exactement ce quune victoire de donald trump signifierait pour les ventes de vhicules lectriques bien que la plupart dentre eux sattendent ÿ un ralentissement de la croissance du secteur le rpublicain ayant dclar quil mettrait fin aux remises fdrales accordes aux acheteurs de voitures malgr cela lhomme le plus riche au monde est devenu lanne dernire lun des plus grands donateurs financiers de lancien prsident en versant plus de 120 millions de dollars par lintermdiaire de son america pac pour soutenir le candidat rpublicain ainsi que des candidats au congrs et au snatil est galement devenu un habitu trs visible des rassemblements de donald trump se prsentant comme un  maga sombre et gothique  lors dun vnement organis au madison square garden le 27 octobre qui a t fortement critiqu pour les remarques racistes de certains orateurs dont lun a qualifi porto rico d le flottante dordures le revirement politique delon musk est quelque peu dconcertant car tesla doit une grande partie de son succs au soutien prcoce du gouvernement obama qui lui a accord un pr¦t ÿ faible taux dintr¦t de 465 millions de dollars pour financer lachat de sa premire usine en californie et qui sous lre biden est le principal bnficiaire des crdits dimpt fdraux pour les voitures lectriques qui les rendent plus abordables pour les consommateurs depuis lre obama spacex delon musk a galement reu des milliards de dollars publics pour le lancement de fuses et de satellites pour le compte de la nasa et du dpartement de la dfense cependant il est aussi ÿ la merci de la chine o lusine de tesla ÿ shanghai est devenue essentielle ÿ sa rentabilit et vite tout commentaire public critique ÿ lgard du parti communiste au pouvoirdans le m¦me temps il a trait la candidate dmocrate ÿ llection prsidentielle kamala harris de  communiste  dans une image gnre par lia et dans une vido grossire cre par america pac le milliardaire a m¦me spcul sur les raisons pour lesquelles personne na essay de lassassiner dans un message sur les rseaux sociaux quil a prtendu ¦tre une blague et quil a supprim depuis ses liens troits avec des dirigeants autoritaires dont le russe vladimir poutine laissent galement prsager des problmes sil devait occuper une fonction officielle au sein de du gouvernement trump les investisseurs se concentrent davantage sur les marges et sur ce quil faudra faire pour dplacer le mtal jeffrey osborne analyste principal de recherche chez td cowenpeut-¦tre plus important encore que son soutien financier direct elon musk utilise x pour promouvoir ÿ la fois donald trump et amplifie activement les mensonges lectoraux et les fausses informations sur les machines ÿ voter et les immigrants sans papiers qui votent illgalement au nom des dmocrates america pac promeut galement un faux programme de campagne dmocrate  progress 2028  dans une campagne publicitaire sur les rseaux sociaux tandis que le chatbot grok cr par xai delon musk diffuse de fausses informations lectorales sur x elon musk est galement confront ÿ des problmes juridiques en raison de ses donations dun million de dollars aux lecteurs des tats clefs qui votent pour donald trump le procureur de philadelphie la poursuivi pour violation des lois lectorales fdrales mais laffaire a t mise en suspens dans lattente dun examen par un tribunal fdralles investisseurs ont t encourags par laugmentation des marges bnficiaires de tesla au cours du dernier trimestre et par la promesse delon musk dune croissance des ventes beaucoup plus importante en 2025 potentiellement en hausse de prs de 50 % par rapport ÿ cette anne cela a fait grimper laction de 22 % le 24 octobre il nest pas facile dintgrer limpact de la politique delon musk dans les modles financiers et les estimations de bnfices par rapport ÿ des donnes plus concrtes a dclar jeffrey osborne analyste principal de la recherche sur les actions chez td cowen qui a attribu une note  hold  aux actions de tesla les investisseurs se concentrent davantage sur les marges et sur ce quil faudra faire pour dplacer le mtal  a-t-il dclar ÿ forbes par exemple la rduction par tesla des taux dintr¦t sur les pr¦ts automobiles pour les acheteurs qui passent de 199 % ÿ 0 % aux tats-unis est un lment positif ÿ court terme  nous avons essay de prendre en compte toutes les options de vente et dachat dans notre modle mais il est difficile de classer lune par rapport ÿ lautre elon musk a longtemps t considr comme un pdg non conventionnel partageant librement ses opinions sur les rseaux sociaux sur une srie de sujets que la plupart des dirigeants dentreprises cotes en bourse vitent cela lui a parfois co¯t cher comme lorsquil a prtendu ÿ tort sur twitter quil avait obtenu des fonds pour privatiser tesla la securities exchange commission lui a inflig une amende de 20 millions de dollars pour cette infraction ainsi quune autre amende de 20 millions de dollars paye par tesla et la contraint ÿ quitter son poste de prsident du conseil dadministration du constructeur automobileplus rcemment il a dfendu des opinions anti-transgenres fait des commentaires sur x considrs comme racistes tels que ceux concernant les pilotes davion noirs et soutenu un message antismite et attaquant les politiques dei ce qui lui a valu les reproches de la national urban league et de lanti-defamation league en plus de lexamen de calpers le dclin de la valeur de la marque tesla est une consquence des changements intervenus dans sa stratgie et sa direction les grands investisseurs ne sont pas les seuls ÿ ¦tre troubls par le virage ÿ droite delon musk il a galement dcourag certains petits investisseurs comme la photographe nancy ney base ÿ miami qui sest dbarrasse de ses dernires actions tesla cette anne je les ai vendues en raison de mon dgo¯t pour le comportement antismite delon musk qui affirme que les juifs veulent remplacer les blancs dans les pays occidentaux par des minorits non blanches  a-t-elle dclar  son soutien aux thories du complot et lutilisation de x comme plateforme pour ses dlires fous sont galement une raison maintenant il soutient trump ment en son nom et achte des votes pour lui les opinions controverses delon musk expliquent galement en partie pourquoi la cote de tesla a chut de 9 % dans la dernire enqu¦te annuelle sur les grandes marques mondiales ralise par interbrand base ÿ londres soit la plus forte baisse parmi les grandes entreprises  le dclin de la valeur de la marque tesla est une consquence des changements intervenus dans sa stratgie et sa direction  a dclar gonzalo brujo pdg mondial dinterbrand  on ignore toujours comment ils vont rinitialiser la marque ÿ long terme compte tenu de la visibilit delon musk dans la sphre politique des obstacles rglementaires quils doivent surmonter et de la force croissante de leur concurrence automobile la faon dont tesla excelle en tant que marque reste une question ouverte ladhsion du cofondateur de tesla ÿ la politique conservatrice est concomitante ÿ la sortie du cybertruck le vhicule delon musk et de tesla sur le segment des vhicules les plus vendus aux tats-unis bien quavec un look polarisant les ventes du vhicule moqu pour son apparence et rappel plusieurs fois depuis sa mise en vente fin 2023 slvent ÿ 28 250 cette anne selon kelley blue book depuis des dcennies les pick-up sont particulirement populaires auprs des acheteurs dont les opinions politiques sont plutt rpublicaines et elon musk a peut-¦tre pens ÿ eux avec le cybertruck a dclar alexander edwards de strategic vision je pense quil esprait attirer de nouveaux rpublicains vers le segment des vhicules lectriques bien que cela nait pas fonctionn aussi bien que souhait car il existe des raisons fondamentales pour lesquelles les rpublicains sont moins susceptibles denvisager un vhicule lectrique  a-t-il dclarlors de la confrence tlphonique sur les rsultats de tesla du 23 octobre elon musk a dclar que des modles moins co¯teux vendus ÿ environ 30 000 dollars avec des remises gouvernementales allaient ¦tre lancs ÿ partir de lanne prochaine ce qui selon lui devrait permettre de gagner de nouveaux clients alexander edwards a dclar que ses enqu¦tes suggraient que de nombreux acheteurs dcourags par elon musk pourraient revenir ÿ la marque  car une tesla correspond ÿ leur vhicule idal et les gens semblent avoir la mmoire courte  cependant nancy ney ancienne actionnaire de tesla ne sera pas de la partie lorsque jachetais une voiture lectrique jai toujours dit que je ne mettrais pas le nom de cet homme dans mon alle  a-t-elle dclar  je nai jamais envisag dacheter une tesla et jai fini par acheter une kia ev que jadore ,-0.1125,negative

173,2024-11-18,every tesla cybertruck recall 2024,tesla didnt invent electric vehicles but it launched ev revolution many other companies had attempted to sell electric cars through decades but tesla was first to succeed part of teslas success came from charisma of its ceo de-facto mascot elon musk more than any other automotive executive industry including henry ford lee iococca elon musk used his own persona to promote his companys carsbut after a few years of dizzying success things started to look wobbly for man behind ev elon musks reputation first faltered when tesla released first concept renderings of cybertruck which apparently was musks passion project ever since first cgi drawings went public automotive enthusiasts have delighted disparaging teslas first truck pontiac aztek a popular comparison but aztek doesnt have a history of shedding body panels onto highwaythe cybertrucks polarizing appearance long delays uneven rollout put first cracks elon musks previously unassailable reputation (musks management of x formerly known as twitter has driven a longer stake through what remained of his popularity) after such a troubled development cycle it was almost surprising when cybertruck finally hit dealer lots instead of getting postponed yet again but now that cybertruck has been on sale for quite some time heres everytime it has been recalled this

didnt really get standardized until a few decades after cars went mainstream however pressing a pedal footwell has made car go faster since beginning but even though pedals have been a solved technology for over a century tesla managed to mess it updue to what tesla calls an unapproved change company began using soap as an assembly lubricant while putting together cybertrucks accelerator pedals as a result pad of pedal can become detached from rest of it pad can then get trapped between main body of pedal cybertrucks distinctively polygonal interior trim this can cause cybertruck to accelerate whether driver wants to or not regardless of whether tesla discreetly half-approved creative use of soap on its production lines  company has since found out why no one else automotive industry does itfortunately for cybertruck drivers anyone on road near them they will not be trapped a runaway vehicle pressing brake pedal will bring cybertruck to a stop one simply needs to ignore all warning lights that some from simultaneously pressing accelerator brakesthe repair tesla will reassemble pedalon june 18 (that two months one day after recall was issued) tesla mailed out notices to cybertruck owners they will reassemble repair pedals free of charge one can assume that there will be no further unapproved use of soap assembly2 june 19 2024 front windshield wiper can failto be fair to tesla windshield wipers are a new technology compared to accelerator pedals but before one gets too generous with ones pardons windshield wipers are powered by electric motors at this point it worth noting (again) that tesla got its start by making first popular vehicles that were powered by electric motors instead of enginesnevertheless texas-based automaker has had a few difficulties with little electric motor under windshield that makes wipers go back forth motor controller can fail at any time leaving driver stuck with motionless wipers that block view on a clear day are useless rain this caused by excessive current going to motors controller which can more or less fry its electronic circuitsthe repair tesla will replace windshield wiper motor controllertesla replacing wiper motor its corresponding controller free of charge presumably this replacement contains some sort of current limiter to prevent replacement parts from shuffling off to salvage heap same way as their predecessors or perhaps some fundamentally redesigned circuitryit rather striking that teslas second cybertruck recall of 2024 was due to well-cooked circuit boards tesla has almost (but not quite) billed itself as an electronics company that makes cars instead of computers therefore it interesting that it didnt manage to prevent a relatively basic issue like overloading circuit boards with too much electricity229relatedthis why cybertruck has a rusting problemtheres more than meets eye when looking at tesla cybertrucks current rusting problem3 june 19 2024 improperly adhered trunk bed trim can detachcybertrucks are molting all over highways what official literature calls sail appliqu flying off of truck effectively becoming futuristic shrapnel for nearby drivers for those who have never heard term so-called sail appliqu a piece of black paneling on top of cybertrucks bed rails without it rain road detritus can freely land inside bed wallsit worth noting that most other trucks have no such trim pieces at all outer inner sides of other truck beds meet with a single-seamed joint however tesla decided to shift a few paradigms by adding a flat piece between inner outer body panels exploring this previously uncharted territory of body design tesla did not quite manage to make a truck bed that could hold itself togetherit may be tempting to speculate that teslas groundbreaking use of stainless steel body panels has made it difficult to attach cladding paneling to vehicle however tesla not first automaker to use stainless steel even delorean a short-lived company that was not known for making durable cars (back to future endorsement notwithstanding) managed to produce vehicles that held onto all of their trim while drivingthe repair tesla will remove replace sail appliquestesla removing replacing sail appliques free of charge however longevity of this repair dubious at best according to teslas own technical service bulletins trim panels question are held on exclusively with push-nuts clips granted many cars use clips push-nuts to attach exterior cladding to main body however most other automakers tend to put a few sturdy bolts onto each trim piece tesla chose not to do this4 september 26 2024 rearview camera image may not display/fmvss 111fmvss (federal moving vehicle safety standards) 111 pertains to rear visibility including windows mirrors cameraslike an internet video loading over a bad connection screen showing view through rearview camera can have a delay this means that cybertruck drivers may not see any hazards for a few seconds after they appear of course danger behind this should be obviousit may be tempting to cut tesla a bit of slack say that rearview cameras are relatively new however they have been standard cars for many years first rearview cameras may have had their technological hiccups but they are now as dependable as speedometers (unless one drives a cybertruck)the repair an over-the-air software updatefortunately for cybertruck owners this a problem that will effectively solve itself tesla sent a software update over air to fix rear cameras delay tesla may have difficulty getting its camera software to work properly before deployment but it can at least fix its problems at no further inconvenience to its customers concerned cybertruck owners can of course verify that their vehicle received software update but if all goes well this recall will not force anyone to take their cybertruck to a tesla dealer wait for it to be fixeddiscussionhow dangerous tesla cybertruckive logged onto twitter (x) many times to see videos of emergency personnel struggling to get into cybertruck reports from drivers saying this thing a death trap however how much of that true i know cybertruck

powerthe inverter that supplies ac electricity to cybertrucks motor can go out without warning rendering motor useless as official notice tactfully puts it on affected vehicles a fault drive inverter

way cybertruck owners can share experience of any ice driver whose oil warning light has turned onthe repair tesla will replace drive invertertesla replacing inverter free of chargegiven that tesla released its first production model 2008  it astounding that company should have such a stunning powertrain failure after so many years while tesla may be constantly introducing radically new technologies to automotive industry (sometimes with success) it has been using electric motors to propel cars for a long time tesla no longer scrappy upstart of automotive industry it truly stunning that at this late stage companys development elon musk would sign off on a powertrain that suddenly dies middle of road particularly when it installed what most tesla fans have come to understand his

174,2024-11-14,how cybertruck became a hollywood reject,on night of a lakers vs dallas mavericks game last january a glossy black vehicle that looked like it had been lifted from set of clone wars pulled up valet line outside cryptocom arena downtown los angeles a town where mclaren lamborghini sightings are as common as glossy headshots above dry cleaner counter it takes a lot to create car buzz yet as door to futuristic-looking truck swung open a small group of onlookers whipped out their smartphones started filming someone my chat said it was sza noted onein fact driver was endeavor ceo ari emanuel who began what looked like a mini contract negotiation with the valet guy as they discussed where emanuel should move his ride which was taking up an inordinate amount of space linethe fuss over emanuels stainless steel cybertruck was owed to fact that at time only people behind wheel of one were limited to a group of people taken off a waitlist who could afford vehicles hefty price tag that starts at $80000 but can rise to well over $100000 if its fully tricked out (that black wrap on car its a $6500 add on) emanuel a longtime friend of musk was one of them tesla ceo sat on endeavors board for a year starting 2021 attended emanuels nuptials two years ago then there was that viral image of emanuel hosing down musk on a boatbut neither emanuels trendsetting powers (he was early on paleo diets treadmill desks) nor cybertrucks years-long anticipatory buzz have made it a mainstay hollywood car once had a waitlist of 2 million people but approximately 97 percent of them canceled now you could have one tomorrow if you wanted indeed endeavor ceo whos always proudly approached public perception with a strong f-u remains virtually only industry executive driving teslas latest most future-stretching offering (emanuel declined to comment for this story)tony vinciquerra chairman ceo of sony pictures openly dismissive of musks latest toy i just looked at one century city mall on sunday he tells me it just doesnt appeal to me an avid enthusiast who over years has owned probably over 100 different cars vinciquerras current drive-to-the-office car a kia ev6 my assistant got one my volt lease was up i was trying to figure out what to replace it with i drove his really liked ithollywoods players have always been early adopters with cash to spare eager to pull up to mr chow or peninsula a statement-blaring vehicle remember when humvees were it car despite it literally being a military vehicle pre-kia ownership vinciquerra owned a handful of chevy volts a corvette zo6 a lucid a porsche 911 turbo cabriolet paramount chairman ceo-in-waiting david ellison proudly sits behind a silver ferrari sony pictures chief tom rothman used to drive his red mustang around lot on monday following a box office win (mustang mondays) when snap chairman michael lynton was chairman ceo of sony he motored a volkswagen gti onto culver city lot showcasing a kind of hollywood executives theyre just like us menschiness that vinciquerra carries forward behind wheel of that kiaso aversion to cybertrucks stands out of course late 2024 message it -- all teslas -- send overlaps a little too jarringly with musk a recent hollywood reporter story noted that tesla sales are down california; both us globally ev sales growth slowing tesla ceos transformation from quirky tony stark-like tech pioneer (remember that iron man 2 cameo) who lived bel-air to bombastic maga supporter texas resident giving away million-dollar checks at trump rallies joining trump family photos at mar-a-lago (where he was stationed on election night ever since) has made it nigh impossible to separate car from its maker (so close he journalist kara swisher has dubbed him elonia after incoming first lady) where he once mingled at oscar parties he now tells bob iger go fuck yourself (musk chummier with wbd ceo david zaslav attending tennis us open with him more on that later)musks broader car empire begs a stickier question if hollywoods leaders have always explicitly or implicitly conveyed their personality values through cars they drive what to do about tesla it has been beloved -- dominant -- car brand amongst vips for well over a decade now speaking to nearly a dozen producers agents studio executives consensus that while cybertrucks are a loud no thank you teslas are an um i dont think so but im still driving it partly this because no eco-friendly brand has stormed enrapt industry en masse way tesla did starting 2012 sure there are rivians lucids polestars out there but its hardly a revolution also people generally like teslas as smooth intuitive machines theyre good cars noted another publicist product above standardin a town obsessed with performance teslas cant be ignored eitherthe companys stock riding high proving how hating on musk -- at least context of his cars -- many ways a fruitless exercise late october teslas stock soared 22 percent when it announced that profits had climbed 17 percent third quarter stock went up another 39 percent after election night -- days before trump named musk as co-head of newly-created decidedly mcu-ish-sounding department of government efficiency according to automotive research firm kelley blue book cybertrucks were third-best-selling ev third quarter following only tesla models 3 y report stated that tesla sold 28250 cybertrucks during first nine months of year (tesla doesnt break out individual model sales)critics warn that tesla hasnt significantly innovated on any of its models years hasnt released a new vehicle -- aside from cybertruck -- since 2020 (as a result information declared tesla not as cool as it used to be silicon valley way back 2021) yet it still leader space part because of seamless vast charging infrastructure it created even vinciquerra admitted that while his kia great if he didnt have a home charger hed have range anxietyi hate to break it to hollywood liberals but teslas still boss when it comes to electric cars says author humorist neal pollack who has written car reviews car culture stories for such publications as popular mechanics wired company doing well its going to continue to innovate love or hate elon musks politics no one can argue that hes not pushing ball forward literally his goal to put people on mars next four years i think his odds are pretty good he sent a tesla into space i didnt see volkswagen doing thatshareteslas takeover of hollywood was swift all-encompassing before model s launched 2012 hollywood was virtue-signaling via toyota prius a gas-electric hybrid that exuded planet-saving intentions but ultimately looked like a bulbous-shaped soccer mom car backed by a savvy marketing campaign by an environmental non-profit that targeted cause-loving celebrities hollywoods executive class prius became a mainstay at red-carpet drop-offs (even if joke was that celebrities would take a limo most of way there then jump into a prius two blocks from event)but once all-electric model s became available with its speedster frame that wouldnt have been out of place a drag race on pch hollywood couldnt get one fast enough trades ran stories about wait lists amongst execu-rati with tesla owners names written boldface tesla model s first sexy green car was one 2012 hollywood reporter headline early owners included steven spielberg jeffrey katzenberg (who publicly thanked musk after his model s protected him a major wreck) participant media founder jeff skoll before long every studio agency parking lot resembled a tesla dealershiphollywoods fetishization of tesla particular but with non-gas cars general helped spread adoption of electric vehicles market them to non-coastal progressives when it came to hybrid electric cars hollywood absolutely drove market said pollack i mean a prius was a joke to rest of country pollack notes how larry david exclusively drove electric cars curb your enthusiasm which simultaneously satirized exalted lives of la elites he had a prius then bmw i3 i think last season it was an electric audi david also drove a ford escape hybrid a bmw ix on show one episode he borrows ted dansons tesla gets into a dust-up with a police officer over cars aggressive beeplater tesla models also became hollywood darlings from model y sports utility vehicle to model x its falcon wing doors which exude luke skywalker vibes extending teslas hollywood reign well over a decade vinciquerra says sony lot mostly teslas even as new electric entrants like rivians lucids mercedes bmws e-models are becoming more popular within industrythe question for how much longer many tesla drivers expressed discomfort over their association with tesla brand especially wake of election we have a tesla i hate cybertrucks i hate elon musk but i also have a lot of tesla stock so im very conflicted all around says one film executive im happy stock price up for obvious reasons but im also horrified by muskbut tesla has made selling cars complicated instead executive has their spouse drive ittesla lease-holders meanwhile are playing waiting game im stuck with one waiting for lease to expire says publicist but many people wont be getting another one its not just for political reasons rest of car manufacturing world finally catching up to teslas technological head start theyre not 100 percent there yet but theyre close there are lots of other options now whether your motive driving an ev or just driving something new innovativemy lease expires march says one manager im going to relinquish it when its over mainly because of musk but also because there are many more [electric car] options nowfor anyone with a cybertruck theres also matter of putting yourself at risk for whats now called cyberbullying -- getting flipped off on road for driving one -- addition to trucks shoddy quality with four recalls over faulty mechanics thus far with execs largely shunning hulking darth vader-esque beast celebrities are most at risk of abuse lady gaga kim kardashian kanye west serena williams are all cybertruck ownersghosts co-executive producer guy endore-kaiser said hes not giving up his two-year-old tesla model s but that today i would not buy a new one i dont see point getting rid of one i already own but i also dont want to put any more money into elon musks pocket asked if he felt any tesla shame or had any desire to slap an i bought this before elon went crazy sticker (available on amazon for $650) on his car endore-kaiser said because its la assumption isnt that youre driving it because you support this new version of elon it doesnt feel like you have to be projecting out some sort of making amends for owning a teslabut if hollywood done with teslas does it matter karl brauer executive analyst at iseecarscom an automotive search engine research website says that while hollywood tech communities are probably single most influential communities a lot of areas including automotive    theyre probably less influential than they were a few years ago as election so strikingly reminded us i think more americans are looking at [tech hollywood] saying look thats their lifestyle but its not necessarily a lifestyle i want to emulateas brauer says musk isnt just losing people hes also gaining people there are people today who are much bigger fans of elon musk than they were three years ago i see enough teslas cybertrucks down here (gop-leaning) orange county on a pretty regular basisof industrys role popularizing teslas pollack adds i dont think that la particular going to be driving this anymore just because suddenly its not cool to own a tesla anymore -- thats kind of like automotive equivalent of canceling your x account like nooo im on bluesky now or im on threadsyet hollywood isnt necessarily totally done with musk infatuation either -- at least as an innovator last month teslas latest event its robotaxi unveiling took place last month on warner bros discovery lot where musk previewed driverless taxis that he says will go into production 2026 (given musks poor record estimating when something will be ready that means anywhere from 2027 to never)he may have unveiled vehicles a bit of hollywood showmanship but event doubled as his latest middle finger to business as producers of blade runner 2049 sued him for using ai-generated images resembling a scene from movie alex proyas director of i robot accused musk of copying his movies designs musk after saying i love blade runner during event responded to being sued by saying that blade runner 2049 suckedbut everyone else i thought it was awesome says manager waiting to get rid of his tesla we need more green space id love to go to work then have my car come get

175,2024-11-02,why elon musks robotaxi dreams are premature,elon musk betting that robot cars will propel tesla into a lucrative new era but hes going about it all wrongmusks plans center on what he has called end-to-end artificial intelligence plan to deluge teslas ai systems with video footage from existing teslas expectation that algorithms running on huge supercomputers will learn how to drive safely he hopes this will make it possible for tesla to deliver fully self-driving cars faster more cheaply than his competitors existing tesla owners would get access next year new specially designed robotaxis would be ready 2026the breakthrough ai of musks dreams contrasts starkly with approach of other companies pursuing autonomous vehicles waymo industry leader already operates commercial robotaxis just announced a $56 billion round of financing waymo which owned by google-parent company alphabet also uses lots of ai but its approach to break down problem of self driving into more distinct tasks with more input from human engineers waymo using data from more sensors including lasers radar which gives companys cars a much richer view of worldin simplest possible terms musks vision for tesla about an ai system that learns by watching people drive waymo others are teaching their vehicles by correcting them as they do driving themselvesmusks bet hinges on current state of ai technology reaching a level of sophistication that it hasnt yet achieved may not for some time ai developers sayone of musks defining characteristics has been an ability to start with a goal mind work backward to solution required with self-driving tech his goal a system affordable enough to put on most any vehiclemusk has said robots self-driving cars could propel teslas market value to at least $30 trillion supporters of his plans point to successes his companies have achieved by drawing outside lines like radical reduction launch costs achieved at spacex which now dominates rocket businessmusk has a long history of overpromising being vague about how exactly his ideas become reality he uses names for teslas driver-assistance technology -- autopilot full self-driving -- that imply more capability than it has tesla has missed all prior targets for release of fully autonomous driving systemsat a tesla robotaxi event this month unveiling an under-$30000 cybercab model with no steering wheel or pedals musk quipped i tend to be optimistic with time frames he predicted production would start before 2027 by teslas earnings call just days later he was saying confidently that large-scale production would happen 2026musk others who have worked on teslas self-driving tech have said its advantage vast amounts of footage of real-world driving captured by cameras built into all of its vehicles -- including all time people have spent using companys existing full self driving (supervised) driver-assistance software usually shortened to fsdtraining teslas ai using this passively recorded data requires a technique known as imitation learning essence to gain any advantage from all this data teslas ai must watch those millions of hours of humans driving try to copy their actions says timothy b lee a computer scientist who writes newsletter understanding aiits like living millions of lives simultaneously seeing very unusual situations that a person their entire lifetime would not see musk said at robotaxi eventteslas backers express confidence that its self-driving work better more extensive than may be publicly apparenttasha keeney director of investment analysis at ark which has long been bullish on tesla says musks company may be keeping many of technical details about its systems secret but that behind scenes it continuing to innovate its ai techniques she recently co-wrote an analysis of teslas robotaxi strategy that argues that by 2029 robotaxis will account for almost 90% of companys enterprise value 60% of its revenue by then she says tesla will be worth about 10 times its current value which around $800 billionin contrast teslas competitors have trained their self-driving systems real world by putting a safety driver behind wheel of a car who takes control when vehicle does something undesirable these companies meticulously track those disengagements feed data back to their engineering teams who tweak system so mistake doesnt happen againthat approach more labor-intensive time consuming expensive but waymo others feed that data into more powerful ultimately more reliable systems through a process known as reinforcement learning says leeresearch into these two approaches has shown that results can be wildly different systems trainedprimarilywithimitationlearning such asteslas can fail when their own actions take them too far outside of realm of data theyve been trained on addition teslas devotion to a fully end-to-end ai system creates a black box of tangled connections which it can be impossible to understand why system does certain things -- or how to correct those behaviorstrying to handicap ai race between waymo tesla difficult says anthony levandowski who co-founded waymo before leaving acrimoniously for uber now head of a self-driving tech company called pronto he believes that musks goal of releasing a fully autonomous driving system a year isnt reasonablecreating a self-driving system of sort musk wants will probably require more advances fundamentals of ai technology itself it isnt clear when those will arrive he addsthe cost of sensors used by waymo others -- including high-resolution cameras radar lidar technology that uses lasers to build 3-d images -- can add up to tens of thousands of dollars not to mention expense of mounting them processing their datateslas vehicles have only cameras computing hardware that generally more modest cost-wise than a waymo vehiclestesla isnt entirely ignoring more sensor-focused approach to self-driving ai technology andrej karpathy a co-founder of openai who also headed ai at tesla from 2017 to 2022 has said that tesla using a small number of vehicles that drive around use a waymo-like suite of onboard sensors to create tesla driving systems maps he said this enables tesla to use some of same rich data that waymo its competitors do then deploy that ai on its regular vehicles that are far cheaper to producebut having this small unit of waymo-like vehicles somewhat undermines musks claims that data from tesla customers vehicles sufficienttesla owners like to document their use of its technology they have posted a great deal of evidence that undercuts argument that its vehicles can operate safely with only camerasteslas current fsd software can drive on most surface streets highways but requires vigilant monitoring by person behind wheel because it can make sudden potentially catastrophic decisions social media full of recent videos of such moments -- cars attempting to turn directly into path of other vehicles blowing through red lights failing to stop for a train foggy conditionsfederal auto-safety regulators recently announced that they are investigating tesla over role its fsd system has played fatal crashestesla didnt respond to several requests for comment on its self-driving systemsteslas own operating manuals specify its system can be blinded by direct sun fog or other inclement weather other self-driving systems that rely on sensors such as radar lidar can navigate these types of conditionsteslas computer vision-only approach never going to work says mary cummings a professor of computer science at george mason university director of its autonomy robotics centera longtime critic of teslas autonomous-driving program -- musk has publicly complained about her -- cummings recently served as senior safety advisor to national highway traffic safety administration which regulates self-driving tech she thinks only way for tesla to even begin to seriously pursue fully autonomous driving to change its approach to sensors by adding moremeanwhile tesla still needs to get permission to test its vehicles on road using safety drivers as waymo others havei think it might be true that to get to a completely autonomous vehicle where it never needs remote assistance you might need something close to human level intelligence says lee i do not think thats a case for

become harder for tesla to get new customers due to his politics said long-time investor former musk fan ross gerber ceo of los angeles-based wealth manager gerber kawasaki who still has a $52 million stake company most ceos intelligently stay out of politics for good reason elon doesnt care about how his right-wing (ironically anti-environmental) support hurts tesla31% of car shoppers say theyre now less likely to consider purchasing a tesla as their next vehicle specifically because of muskmultiple consumer surveys back this up for example 46% of people market for an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle identify as democrats while only 21% 25% of buyers of those vehicles say they are republicans according to data from strategic vision a san diego-based research firm that surveys tens of thousands of consumers weekly auto researcher edmunds found its most recent survey data that 31% of car shoppers say theyre now less likely to consider purchasing a tesla as their next vehicle specifically because of muskmusks behavior has turned off democrats at times abandonment of democratic party for tesla was significant strategic vision ceo alexander edwards told forbes adding that it also hasnt done much to drive ev sales to republicans net result a substantial drop future consideration of a tesla by any automotive buyer todayhis political gamble comes at an awkward time for tesla though it managed to boost sales third quarter year to date brands global sales volume down 23% us teslas sales this year through september are down 45% even as overall ev sales are up 87% according to cox automotive california a highly democratic state thats been key to teslas success since its founding remains top domestic market tesla sales are down about 13% this yearmajor public companies ceos us particularly those that sell products to general public typically avoid overt political partisanship to avoid alienating potential customers musks fanboy embrace of trump has made tesla an outlier its clear that teslas board not inclined at least not publicly to set limits on his often divisive public commentary neither tesla nor chair robyn denholm responded to an email asking if she other board members have discussed implications of musks campaign efforts for trump with himmusks outspoken positions on social issues particularly his recent hostility to corporate diversity equity inclusion policies has led california public employees retirement system or calpers which owns tesla shares worth about $18 billion to review its investment carmaker that was sparked by a letter to

man has past year become one of former presidents biggest financial donors contributing more than $120 million through his america pac to support republican nominee as well as congressional senate candidateshes also become a highly visible regular fixture at trump rallies declaring himself to be dark gothic maga at a madison square garden event on oct 27 thats been heavily criticized for racist remarks by some speakers including one who called puerto rico a floating island of garbagemusks political shift a bit of a headscratcher since tesla owes much of its success to early support from obama administration which provided a low-interest $465 million loan to fund purchase of its first factory california during biden era top beneficiary of federal tax credits for electric cars that make them more affordable for consumers since obama years musks spacex has also received billions of public dollars for rocket satellite launches on behalf of nasa defense department yet hes also at mercy of china where teslas shanghai plant has become essential to its profitability avoids any public comments critical of ruling communist partyat same time hes assailed democratic presidential candidate kamala harris as a communist an ai-generated image with a crude video created by america pac even speculated about why no one has tried to assassinate her a social media post he claimed was a joke has since deleted his close ties to authoritarian leaders including russias vladimir putin also suggest problems were he to serve any official capacity a trump administrationinvestors are more

models earnings estimates compared with more concrete data inputs isnt easy to do said jeffrey osborne a senior equity research analyst at td cowen who has a hold rating on tesla sharesinvestors are more focused on margins what it will take to move metal he told forbes for example teslas reduction of interest rates on car loans for buyers to 0% us from 199% a near-term positive weve tried to factor all of puts takes into our model but its hard to rank order of one vs othermusk has long been seen as an unconventional ceo freely sharing his views on social media on a range of topics that most leaders of public companies steer clear of this has cost him personally at times such as when he falsely claimed on twitter - before he purchased it turned it into x - that he had secured funding to take tesla private securities exchange commission hit him with a $20 million fine for that infraction along with another $20 million paid by tesla forced his removal as chairman of carmakers

troubled by musks right turn hes also turned off some small retail investors like miami-based photographer nancy ney who dumped her remaining tesla shares this yeari sold them because of my disgust

advantages under trump 20 setting up for a potentially lucrative year ahead so should you place your bets on stock now can tesla reach $500 mark next year lets dive to see how trumps return to white house could shape teslas futuretrumps harsh stance on evs how tsla might remain unscathedthroughout his campaign trump expressed strong skepticism about evs promising to end ev mandate on his first day office frequently stating that evs dont work his administration could reduce or eliminate subsidies that support ev industry including current $7500 federal tax credit for ev purchases however teslas strength lies its ability to weather these changes due to its cost efficiency economies of scaletesla operates as one of lowest-cost producers ev market thanks to its extensive vertical integration -- from battery manufacturing to software development -- its global gigafactories that drive down production costs as such tesla could emerge less affected by subsidy cuts than competitors like rivian rivn which are yet to achieve profitability may face hurdles a subsidy-free environment teslas production efficiency coupled with its high brand loyalty provides it a strong foundation to maintain its growth profits even without incentives that benefit other ev startups as well as traditional automakers like general motors gm ford f whose ev businesses are still incurring lossestrumps trade policies advantage tesla us markettrumps trade stance particularly his tough approach toward china could also boost teslas position us market us currently imposes a 100% tariff on chinese evs trump has warned of raising this to 200% for chinese evs manufactured mexico imported to united states such tariffs could create significant barriers for chinese automakers like byd co ltd nio that

179,2024-11-07,teslas stock faces significant overvaluation amidst core business struggles,in q3 tesla posted a 78% yoy increase revenue consistent with recovery trend observed q2 tesla has used pricing adjustments to improve its competitiveness market but intense ev market competition has largely constrained its revenue growth high-interest rates have also impacted customers affordability although these pressures may have peaked companys recent revenue gains were primarily from revenue growth energy generation storage business (+52% yoy) services business (+20% yoy) while automotive revenue grew just 2% yoy amid challenges facing ev market broader economic pressures this shows that automotive segment not growth driver for tesla right now with revenue beat primarily driven by energy businesstheres a lot of talk market about teslas broader tech focus moving forward but reality tesla still an automotive business heavily reliant on government credits regulatory automotive credits reached $739 million q3 fy24 up from $554 million q3 fy23 however these credits are not sustainable long-term as they are temporary government incentives while tesla benefits from them for now its still extremely dependent on them as these credits have a 100% profit margin they significantly influence teslas financials excluding these credits teslas diluted eps would be just $041 compared to current $062tsla data by gurufocusalongside this gross margins ebitda margins declined yoy q3 (as shown above) signaling deeper issues within core auto business compounding these problems fact that teslas net income still remains quite weak heavily dependent on regulatory credits (makes up ~39% of teslas net profit) indicating weak organic growth current price war ev sector further intensifying teslas ability to expand margins deliver strong bottom-line results unfortunately outlook does not show a turnaround happening anytime soon as even musk admitted earnings call that maintaining these levels of profitability would be challenging over next few quarters investors should be aware that improving operating leverage not teslas primary focus at this time; with a variety of ongoing projects requiring further investment eps growth could disappoint near termtesla definitely holds growth potential but timelines for these opportunities are lengthy with a significant amount of uncertainty involved while tesla aims to be starting volume production for cybercab by 2026 investors should be cautious about overestimating these prospects significant obstacles remain including regulatory approval technological advancements market acceptance although long-term potential of autonomous driving undeniable i dont foresee meaningful market penetration until mid-to-late 2030s even if advancements are achieved they are likely to be gradual costly consequently current excitement around tesla seems to have inflated its valuation metrics beyond what may be justified at this point[tesla ir]teslas energy business though exciting showing rapid growth another long-term play that unlikely to significantly impact companys overall performance near term energy segments revenue doubled over past year contributing to teslas gross margin improvement as it has higher margins than automotive business (mid-20s vs high teens) however this business remains a small part of teslas overall revenue mix wont overshadow automotive business for several years i expect that earliest significant impact from energy storage business will occur late 2020s (around 2028 or 2029)teslas cash flow composition increasingly worrying q3 fy24 cash from operations (cfo) rose to $63 billion up from $33 billion q3 fy23its highest ever for a third quarter however if you break down cfo excluding contributions from accounts payable ($26 billion) stock-based compensation ($457 million) regulatory credits ($739 million) core cash flow would only be $247 billion not $63 billion for a company aiming for a trillion-dollar valuation such heavy reliance on these non-sustainable sources concerning additionally tesla could face significant cash burn future possibly billions annually this risk will likely grow as tesla invests heavily ai hardware network infrastructure for its energy business autonomous driving technologies these financial pressures could reduce teslas cash reserves raising doubts about its ability to sustain growth profitability amid such challengestsla data by gurufocusgiven ongoing challenges teslas core automotive business increasing uncertainty surrounding its autonomous driving technology i maintain that stock at risk of a substantial re-rating if tesla shares were trading at a more attractive valuation i might be more optimistic about companys prospects however as shown chart from gurufocus teslas stock currently trading at an almost 71x forward price-to-earnings (p/e) multiple this extraordinary especially when compared to rest of magnificent 7 which trade at significantly lower multiples ranging from 15x to 35x forward p/e moreover teslas current forward p/e multiple significantly higher than its 15-year average of 55x this relative valuation does not paint a favorable picture for tesla although company has historically traded at a premium to its peers i expect teslas valuation to compress below its 15-year average of 55x likely approaching 50x mark as companys operational struggles continue as a result of broader industry macro challenges based on this expectation my target price for tesla $159 per share representing a downside risk of about 30% as multiple compresses from current 71x level to 50x[alpha spread]to corroborate high valuation indicated by relative analysis i also applied a discounted cash flow (dcf) model this model which assumes a base case of 14% cagr revenue over forecast period line with wall street expectations (though i believe this to be somewhat optimistic) still supports my reasoning for teslas overextended valuation its important to note that tesla has recently faced multiple downward revisions revenue forecasts reflecting markets expectations for weaker growth due to challenges discussed earlier article dcf model also factors margin compression through first three years of forecast aligning with consensus estimates followed by a margin improvement later forecast period as energy business begins to contribute more significantly for this dcf analysis i used an 8% discount rate which corresponds to teslas wacc a 3% terminal growth rate to account for companys gradual transformation away from heavy reliance on automotive sector driven by growth its energy business despite these assumptions dcf model yields a fair value of $20015 per share implying a downside risk of over 25%in light of teslas ongoing challenges within its core automotive business combined with uncertainties surrounding its growth catalysts premium valuation i remain cautious about stocks near-term prospects while tesla may eventually recover timeline for meaningful progress still quite unclear current valuation leaves little margin for error as such i recommend a sell on tesla with a close watch on any signs of an operational turnaround,0.0994874,positive

being used thus transportation of cities will be completely changed there will also be a new source of income for teslathroughout presentation musk drew different descriptions of ai features that cybercab had he said it uses a camera-based system to drive avoid obstacles this tactic a differentiating factor to their competitors such as waymo who employ a hybrid system of cameras lidar radar sensors teslas plan closely based on effects of machine learning computer vision to cope with autonomy of carthe introduction of cybercab has come during a deciding moment for tesla because company needs to stay at top as an electric autonomous car manufacturer nevertheless event was more of nepotism for company as recently reported resignations by some top executives coupled with capacity issues leadership caused event to be overshadowedover past ten days four top executives have moved out of tesla which definitely has attracted attention within outside company due to huge loss talent roughly one-third of musks direct reports have left team during this period there were also rumors about what might be going wrong whether teslas approach to managing talented people could be

mehr als die marktkapitalisierung der drei etablierten automobilkonzerne general motors ford und stellantis zusammen gleichzeitig war der sprung von tesla der zweithchste den der aktienkurs jemals gemacht hat erst im mai 2013 also vor mehr als zehn jahren gab es eine strkere bewegungder kurz nach us-brsenschluss verffentlichte bericht zeigt dass tesla im dritten quartal 2024 mit 072 us-dollar pro aktie deutlich mehr gewinn gemacht hat als bisher erwartet dies war auf die deutliche senkung der durchschnittlichen kosten pro elektroauto auf 35100 us-dollar zur¬ckzuf¬hren den niedrigsten jemals erreichten wert dabei halfen auch die hohen einnahmen aus dem verkauf von co2-gutschriften - insgesamt hat tesla im jahr 2024 bereits gut 2 milliarden us-dollar verdient mehr als im gesamten vorjahr das unternehmen schrieb auerdem dass es diesem jahr ein leichtes wachstum bei den auslieferungen von elektroautos erzielen knne daf¬r wre ein allzeitrekord im vierten quartal erforderlichzu den erwarteten umstzen im kommenden jahr steht dem bericht nichts doch ceo musk uerte sich dazu der anschlieenden konferenz mit analysten mit etwas risiko wollte er eine grobe schtzung einer 20-30-prozentigen steigerung der auslieferungen abgeben er erklrte das ist deutlich mehr als analysten zuletzt von tesla erwartet hatten ihre durchschnittliche prognose lag vor der q3-verffentlichung bei knapp 18 millionen verkauften elektroautos im kommenden jahr sogar etwas weniger als 2023 mit 1808 millionen und wenn tesla die optimistische prognose abgeben w¬rde der neue q3-bericht vielleicht auch im jahr 2024f¬r musk und sein unternehmen liege die zukunft der k¬nstlichen intelligenz doch am mittwoch ginge es um margen und umsatzaussichten mit denen tesla selbst optimistische erwartungen ¬bertraf schrieb analyst dan ives von wedbush securities nach der konferenz auf x beides sei musik den ohren der tesla-bullen die viel beachtete gewinnmarge ohne den verkauf von co2-gutschriften war zuvor viele quartale lang auf 146 prozent gesunken bevor tesla im dritten quartal 2024 mit einem wert von gut 17 prozent ¬berraschte f¬r ives hat das unternehmen das schlimmste hinter sich -

190,2024-10-24,why tesla may be riding on path to financial distress,in 2009 tesla was still a startup process of establishing itself market held a cash balance of $70 million while it was nice for this startup to have a notable cash balance accomplishment would be overshadowed by negative operating cash flows topping -$81 million along with operating expenses adding -$12 million to those losses leaving them with a negative free cash flow of -$93 million these losses could have been seen as signs of a failing business model however company managed to secure a $465 million low interest loan from us department of energy which marked a pivotal moment at one of most critical time providing necessary funds to develop its first mid-priced production vehicle tesla model-s set to begin production 2011 pricing of base model was about $50000putting it well below pricing of tesla roadster which usually came with about a $100000 price tag reduction pricing of base model-s was also assisted by a $7500 us federal tax credit further supporting future growth teslas mission of growing consumer base outside existing high premium luxury favor expanding into a bigger pool of consumers who were unable to afford previous models though price tag of $50000 still priced out a good majority of consumers this 50% price reduction was a massive step right direction much of which would not be possible without help from federal government whose financing enabled tesla to invest these technologies set foundation for future growththe years from 2010 to 2013 were characterized by substantial fluctuations teslas financial performance 2010 tesla went public at $17 a share raising over $226 million during its initial public offering (ipo) by 2012 model s was finally launched after years of development going back all way to 2007 this generated significant revenue doubling from $204 million 2011 to $413 million 2012 but operating cash flow remained deep negative capping at -$264 million along with additional hindrance of rising capex which hit $239 million as it expanded manufacturing capabilities of its fremont facilitythis focus on investment into expansion would continue into 2013 when they announced that european residents would be getting ample access to superchargers by end of year as tesla began to ramp up their new assembly line tilburg nederland with objective of boosting european production of model-s model x models this obviously led to 2013 being yet another year of high capex which capped at -$239 million though for first time expenditures were offset by higher operating cash flow of $265 million thus achieving first ever positive year of fcf clocking at $1 million thanks to rising sales volumes during this period tesla succeeded raising more funds this time form of convertible bond offering totaling over $1 billion q2 2013 total tesla had managed to accumulate a cash balance of $849 million by end of year mainly attributed to debt issuance raising more capital thus further illustrating high costs associated with scaling production r&d within company2014-2017 road to profitabilitybetween 2014 2017 teslas profitability experienced a significant decline largely due to companys aggressive growth strategy this period was characterized by significant capital expenditures (capex) aimed at expanding production capacity infrastructure were exasperated by technical issues mainly due to multiple failed attempts at properly automating fremont site which resulted multiple revisions requiring heavier r&d which drove up cost largely for building out a process for cars that werent even production yet namely tesla model-x model-3 which did not launch until 2015 2017 respectively a situation which was partly worsened by notable delays production of these models as all of technical issues were sorted out this led to an overall drop production profit revenue an exponential increase r&d costs contributing to rising capex during this time company was working on another key initiative construction of gigafactory 1 nevada this factory was designed to domestically produce lithium-ion batteries more cost-effectively was constructed between 2014 2017 costs associated with building this factory topped $5 billion though these costs were slightly offset by tax benefits provided by state of nevada totaling $13 billion dollars along with being exempt from sales for next 20 years 10 years of property tax as promising of an offer that was this still unsurprisingly resulted capex escalating following years rising from about -$1 billion 2014 to -$16 billion 2015 -$1281 billion 2016 to more than $34 billion by 2017 placing immense pressure on cash flow profitability as cash outflows during this time began to consistently exceed cash inflows with fcf between 2014 2017 being -$1027b -$2159b -$1405b -$3476b respectively this was followed by multiple credit downgrades from moodys which ultimately ended teslas senior notes being downgraded to caa1 from b3 gave company a negative outlook planned on lowering teslas rating further if company continued to experience shortfalls model-3 production despite these economic issues tesla was able to get through it even though it was riding on a direct path to bankruptcy tsla managed to secure financing mainly by diluting its shareholders issuing more shares convertible debt which were readily bought by investors; if not for this investment capital it very likely tesla would have fallen under2018-2019 setting stage for profitability productionthe years 2018 2019 were trend shifting years for tesla as it had just weathered through most negative period companys life mainly thanks to many sources of financial support it maintained throughout now that it had completed a painful growth stage it could now focus on achieving profitability amidst rising production demands company ended year of 2018 with a cash balance of $3879 billion operating cash flow of $2098 billion though capex remained elevated at $2101 billion leaving company slightly red with -$3 fcf during that year a major improvement over last few years which had primarily aimed at ramping up model 3 production expanding gigafactory 1 2019 followed a similar trend with capex falling operating cash slightly rising due to rising sales volumes company being well into launch of its previous models2020-2023 breakthroughs market turbulencethe year 2020 marked a significant milestone for tesla as it produced delivered nearly half a million vehicles operating cash flow soared to $59 billion while capex rose to $31 billion; mainly driven by investments into gigafactory shanghai ongoing construction of gigafactory berlin texas it was during this period that tesla would take majority market share gross margin starting at 17% 2017 topping out at around 26% of worlds gross margin by 2022 surpassing likes of catl byd major incumbent carmakers which include bmw ford gm honda hyundai kia mercedes-benz nissan renault stellantis toyota volkswagensource ieaduring this time teslas stock performance was on a major winning streak rising from about $113 a share 2020 all way to ath of $124349 a share by end of 2021 this rise aligns with sudden boost venture capital within sector during those years as seen this chart provided by ieasource ieainvestment would begin to slow significantly 2022 this slowdown was alignment with shares of tsla dropping over 70% from $1200 to about $300 over course of just a few months this drop was paired with rising capex which more than doubled 2021 2022 to $77 622 billion respectively though cfo did at least manage to keep pace for those years rising to about $115 $147 billion main factors that were linked rising capex was ongoing rollout of giga texas which would come to fruition 2022 but lack of investor interest within sector were due to rising shipping costs shortages of materials semiconductors an overall consensus of falling guidance within sector by various firms investors as a response to fallen liquidity tsla announced a 3-for-1 stock split executed august 2022 now making stock $300 per share vs $900 previously; but this only resulted more selling bearish positioning on stock being raised which eventually would lead to stock falling to $101 by 2023 followed heightened concerns regarding long-term value particularly given pressures from rising capex market competition which had started to surpass teslas market share during year as illustrated this stacked chart below we can see a concerning recent trend of slowing operating cash flows paired with trend of rising capex with recent 2 data points even showing a falling of cash flows which has led free cash flow to fall half from $85 billion 2022 to $43 billion 2023 all way down to $172 billion over trailing twelve month period bolstering even higher capex lower operating cash flowsource authorthis trend of falling spreads between cfo capex can be further simplified by viewing operating cash flow as a percent of capex when it above 100% it means more money inflowing through their operations than out but when its below it means they are outflowing cash form of capex at a higher rate than they are inflowing through cfosource authoras seen above tsla trending towards a dangerously unstable cash flow situation where this percentage about to go below 100% for first time since 2018 which if left unchecked could lead to much of progress company has made over years being completely wiped out past tsla has relied on venture capital low interest loans debt issuance to bail it out of these situations but during this time of rising interest rates a shrinking supply of available lenders falling venture investing activity rising shipping rates last but not least rebound of inflation which has led to a rise revival of rare earth metals as evident by this chart of rare earth metals price indexsource marketvectorcomthis rise rare earth pricing will likely lead to even higher capex spend future likely to drag down not only tsla but other auto manufactures too such as ford who has been going through its own struggles with supply shipping issues that iv already covered detail my previous coverage of ford motors as for ways of potentially investing into rare earth metals my stock of choice sqm which i also recently covered detaila crucial aspect of teslas growth narrative its shift focus from high-end consumers to a broader market initially tesla targeted affluent buyers with premium-priced vehicles like model s model x which often had price tags exceeding $70000 this strategy positioned tesla as a luxury automaker established a reputation for performance sustainabilityhowever as market evolved tesla recognized importance of catering to average consumers launch of model 3 price starting at around $35000 aimed to attract a broader demographic making electric vehicles more accessible this strategic pivot was essential for driving production volumes solidifying teslas status as a mass-market playersummary & economic projectionsteslas story that of a company that went from a cash-strapped startup to an industry leader electric vehicles this growth has been marked by dire whiffs of financial challenges generally followed by worthwhile yet costly achievements since 2009 company has navigated long periods of intense capital expenditures weak operating cash flow but has been supported through these times by government financing & incentives shareholder dilution a high supply of venture capital to fund its aggressive growth despite overcoming numerous production setbacks financial strain teslas financial stability remains question with recent trends raising concernsthe latest data points to a troubling shift teslas cash flow dynamics particularly with recent narrowing of gap between operating cash flows capital expenditures this has led to free cash flow plummeting from $85 billion 2022 to just $172 billion over trailing twelve month period as of q2 2024 these issues combined with rising costs of raw materials rising competitive pressures falling investor interest threatens to undo much of progress companys made over yearsteslas reliance on venture capital debt issuance government incentives has been crucial during times of financial distress however with rising interest rates constrained lending advent of rising rare earth metals prices that will serve to drive up production costs companys ability to navigate future headwinds based on previous trends appear limitedgiven above concerns it my opinion that shares of tsla at current price of $21780 are extremely overvalued with a trailing twelve month p/e of 6118 at an eps of $356 which puts share of tesla at a worse value than 9012% of industry of 982 companies where median ratio sits at a 1595 trailing p/e meaning that tsla shares are currently trading at a price about 4x above industry median which could lead to severe declines case of a mean reversion potentially to around $56 per share would put it within fair p/e valuationssource gurufocusthe companys ability to finance its debts has come to a major crawl as of 2021 with very little growth seen year of 2023source macrotrendsnetthis inability to find willing lenders to finance debts with has come alignment with accelerating trend of declining ebitda falling from high of $1740 billion q4 2022 to current low of $1160 billion as of q2 2024 report representing about a 65% earnings decline just last few quarterssource macrotrendsnetthis has also had a very negative on net margins declining from 3150% q4 2023 to flatlining to approximately 55% previous two quarterly reports 2024 putting it even below lows of 2023source tradingviewcomthese deteriorating earnings along with rising costs absence of financing crutch that company has relied on so much past lead me to believe we will see stock trade back down closer to valuation metrics as i mentioned earlier i project it would be likely for tsla to trade closer to p/e of industry median of 1595 which would put it at about 56 dollars a share currently; this would be a better case scenario assuming company able to turn things around but at a worst case scenario i think it could trade towards book value current price to book (p/b) sits at 1047 meaning that its trading about 10x above market value of its assets this shows that market pricing future growth however this well above many of its competitors which primarily sit at a ratio below 1xsource gurufocusif tsla truly were to go into liquidation have all aspects of future growth priced out we would likely see shares of stock decline 8-10x which could place stock at about $20 a share which would bring marketcap down to around $69 billion if this were to happen i speculate that a bigger automaker such as toyota (tm) who more established within industry may look to acquire teslas assets ip at a discount to bookgiven that we are talking on such a macro level it only fitting that we measure price-action on log scale chartsource tradingviewcomthe above chart a log scale 5-wave ab=cd structure that terminates approximately at 4272 extension around $343 tsla has already faced one rejection from this level bounced off of one of previous support/resistance zones which are marked green it has since tried to stage a rally above zone perhaps to test out previous top but has so far failed to get any meaningful momentum looks to be staging a 3rd lower high if price action continues this trend into end of month we will have a confirmed bearish engulfing candle on 1-month timeframe this would act as a strong bearish confirmation increase likelihood of price coming down towards nearby support around $101 again if this happens it will confirm bear trend likely result support breaking from then on there would not be any real support until it reaches zones between $32 $10 which would be alignment with projections made based off financial valuation metrics iv reviewed today,0.0671495,positive

death of a 71-year-old woman who had gotten out of her vehicle to help at a crash scene november 2023 according to federal state authoritiesthe investigation marks another step national highway traffic safety administrations long-running effort to scrutinize teslas driver-assistance systems which have been linked to numerous crashes multiple deaths it highlights ongoing questions about safety even as company promising to put fully autonomous vehicles on road as early as next year a far more complicated technological feat than assisting a human driverthe new probes focus on bad

new york who specializes emerging automotive technologies said new investigation could be linked to teslas decision to prioritize cameras its automated systems other kinds of sensors like radar laser-based lidar can help detect obstacles even when visibility poor musk has previously said that lidar was unnecessary that automakers who relied on it were doomedtesla made this decision when lidar was really expensive for whatever reason they seem to be sticking with it wansley said teslas position on sensors has always been a bit of an outlier so its definitely worth investigationmusk has said that roads are designed to be navigated by vision relying on drivers eyes brains but steven shladover a research engineer at university of california at berkeley said cameras can struggle same kinds of fog dust that make it hard for a human driver to seeif it doesnt recognize that theres a problem up ahead its not necessarily going to do anything other than continue to drive shladover saidnhtsa has little power to review technology on vehicles before they are sold to public relying instead on its authority to investigate safety problems order automakers to make fixes agency

does confuse people templeton saidin april a tesla model s using full self-driving hit killed a motorcyclist outside seattle tesla has issued recalls for full self-driving at least twice past one case 2023 it issued an update to system to address cases of vehicles speeding behaving unpredictably or illegally at intersections nhtsa said friday that recall was linked to an earlier federal investigation into teslas systemsseveral reports from washington post have detailed flaws autopilot full self-driving systems beginning last year issues included teslas decision to eliminate radar leading to an uptick crashes near misses involving its driver-assistance systems along with ability of drivers to activate autopilot outside conditions for which it was designedin one crash involving

of america senior automotive analyst john murphy murphy - who joined automotive hall of fame 2023 - shares his bullish outlook on tesla after company shocked most on wall street with its third quarter earnings results veteran analyst modeling for double-digit percentage sales earnings growth 2025 2026 as musks efforts gain holdthis of course podcast that will make you smarter about investing stocks you know what maybe even life normally i would do a stock of day here but i want all time to go to our feature interview that john murphy bank of america senior auto analyst johnso um youre full on on tesla youve covered tesla for a while what caught me amongst many things your noteswell pick apart your analysis you cover to company tesla about to enter its second wave of growthwhat does that look like to youso i mean i i think um you know i i its new core to future uh company it sounds kind of weird because we we our comments we have this framework of core to future basically leveraging ice business truck business to fund future which a v evs uh tesla obviously at that next level uh with their evs and their a vs to some degreeum what youre seeing this this this real wave of core being sort of new products that are coming next year as well as some beyond that that are funding futureand what we just saw was um you know gross uh an improvement gross margin thats helping fund this futureso i think what were seeing evidence uh of funding of that that future future um cyber cabnext gen next gen models um potentially uh full self full self driving sooner than people uh are are thinking uh as well as potentially the roboticsum you know that they theyve shown at at at robo taxi day um as well as uh energy storageso you think about that theres kind of a uh you know uh uh you know soup of things thereum when if you think about a stock like this theres this huge opportunity curve out there um or frontier of all these things that can go right potentially for company then you have this very strong core thats developing right now thats funding thatso um wave gonna look like many many different thingsum it may take many different shapes as as we progress through next few yearsuh no its its pretty uh its pretty impressive i think when you look at um what this you know whats going on at tesla you know you have i mean its not tesla but you have elon um with spacex everything thats going on tesla xa i um i think we have a real innovator whether you like him or notum but its really kind of shocking world bringing a lot to table you know weve had a lucky run here with tesla with almost free capital for you know better part of a of a decadeso hes been given tens of billions of dollarsum but reality hes done something really uh amazing with it its really uh pushing envelope uh which i think gonna be great for humanity over timehopefully hopefully americans as someone that has covered this companyhow he able to surprise wall street deliveri i would say a very surprising third quarter but i would say a surprising year then come out with things that most people thought wouldnt even existwell i think answer no doesnt exist free line if its uh possible at all he pushes forwardand i think it a very important thing that other companies uh face its a constraint on on capitaland that really um that really importanti mean when youre focused on profits returns short run you can of often lose focus on sort of 1 to 20 year vision what you really need to do to drive those earnings going forward and new products new products going forwardso i think with the luxury um of his uh i mean his celebrity to some degree um as well as his intelligence um as far as getting things done and dreaming about them it really provides uh you know not that other companies dont have they get mulligans other folks dont i mean you know fsd has had some issues um you know be a perfect elons got some of his own issues but when you look at um you know crew at at gm i mean they had one you know unfortunate event that was handled horribly from apr perspectiveum but they got put penalty box had that happened at tesla probably would have handled be been handled better from apr perspectivebut uh um you know they would have blown they would have blown through itso um you know so theres a lot theres a lot of things that are that are going on there but answer no doesnt existand idea that uh you have to hit certain profit return hurdles short runum theyre unconstrained from in a a significant way which very important for you know long term value creationi wanna go im gonna well go more into tesla but ive had some time ive been able to spend some time this year at mary barra ceo of general motorsthey had a good quartertheyre doing lots of things electric vehicleswhy isnt therethat it doesnt feel like theres that excitement around what gm doingyou know theyre theyre theyre pumping out great product right nowi mean even even equinox uh you know mid $30000 ev uh we got to drive it tennessee a couple weeks back it really uh really great productum you know theyre doing all right thingsuh but reality theyre constrained by sort of this view that they are and a pure auto company which largely what they areum theyre encumbered by a bad business in china nowi mean weve been saying that something has to be done with thatweve been saying for um you know for years now that they should they should they should exit chinatheres you know we could go we could spend hours on on sort of geopolitics um industrial strategy there that would have driven that uh should have driven that decision years backum but theyve got great stuff uh with with ultimate platform with crewum you know onstar has been a great product for them that theyve they got a check for me every monthyeahwell they theyve never been able to really really monetize in a way that they shouldand i think theres another thing that the core companies like gm dont understandi i i said core future for for uh for for tesla but for a company like gm right theres core north american truck business where they make you know large large majority of of their moneybut theres also this opportunity working with their dealers this gets into mundane but its very important because it could generate tremendous amounts of earnings cash flow where if they worked harder maintaining lifetime uh customer relationship a way that they dont usually they lose a customer after 3 to 4 years out of their dealershipsum they could monetize these vehicles for a much longer period of time simple stuff like parts you know parts for parts parts service then lifetime subscriptions other things that they could participate over time dealers could probably double triple of their profit takeand gm would have a very a very significant uh vig off that if you will or or or or or or or or sheriff i put it put it put it put it real termsum tesla getting this righttheyre building their install base theyre maintaining that relationship with customernow i dont think you need to disinter dealersyou actually wanna leverage them a a very significant way but tesla set up to hold on to that lifetime customer relationship a way that that gm for other incumbents probably could but they havent quite gotten there yetso once again on core side of business tesla doing something that probably a lot better than what incumbents are doingum you know i mean were gonna have to reassess things as as as uh stock stock takes off part of our thesis on on tesla their access to low cost capitaluh so you know reality if they raise 10 percent um you know if they did a 10% capital raise right now you know would be a bit dilutivei but i think shareholders would would share it you raise 80 to $90 billion of of capital that you could put on your balance sheet to execute on all these these opportunitiesso it almost a auto correlated um you know financial instrument in a way that if you just you know if you use it leverage it you really can you know accelerate growthi wanna try to go line by line on your calli mean i always read your notes but cyber truck semi truck i thought these were niche products theretherethey still well for moment they niche because theyre theyre theyre small volume but they could become bigger over timeand you know this this gonna be a very weird thing on on on cyber truckuh cyber truck is depending on your taste a little bit different lookingill ill ill ill leave it at thatuh whats very interesting about about cyber truck um there are wraps on these vehicles rightthey take it from ive seen wraps all orange blue some of raps some of them are a little bit more mundane and make vehicle look really goodi mean those things might make you make vehicle look good depending on your taste uh but when you you know look like a you know aaa reynolds rap you know vehicle you know rolling down rolling down street you know some people like that most people dont but these raps that theyre start to sell with vehicle um make it look a bit more normal so it becomes a little bit more mainstreamso i dont think were gonna be looking at something thats like an 800000 unit pickup truck run like ford does with f f series does this thing rival f seriesno no i think i think i think youre looking at a very good product that maybe gets to 100 maybe 100 50000 units um next 1 to 2 years then burns out like all pro product does over timebut thats far better than we werewe were thinking i mean we were kind of limiting it at 50000i thought that was gonna be owned by like a bitcoin owners you know quite a few bitcoin owners do own itso i mean thats kind of way way it had way with way it has goneum you know on on semi side thats still a tbdi mean were gonna were gonna see some volume ramp up next year but it really wont hit um real volume until 2026and theres a lot of debate on whether you really should be electrifying um you know semis and sort of could you go fuel cell or does diesel actually still a very efficient formatmake make more senseso i think theres a theres a big debate there a big question mark thereso volumes on that might be relatively small toodo you do you really think tesla can hit thatthey came out with 20% to 30% volume growth protection for next yearum i think youre going to need to see these new models launch rightyoure gonna need to see uh derivatives of three why theyre a lower price pointweve had a long a long take that you need to create or democratize uh ev to increase volumes so people can buy them at a an affordable price actually have a better cost of ownershipso i think thats gonna be incumbentum thats gonna be necessary to get to that that growth rate um even our 17 to 18%so were taking this slight slight under on thatum but reality youre gonna put another you know a couple 100000 units on road more on a year over year basis another 21 million units incrementally that may create incremental revenue over time to youum whether it be fsd or whether you actually get um you know those vehicles into a a cyber cab fleet if you will um that you know could generate even even more money over timebut that thats thats a little bit far fetched next yearbut i mean idea that youre gonna have new product is gonna be key to driving that growthlike i know analysts sometimes do like tear downs of carswe we so we for for over 20 years weve done something called who makes car rightso weve picked a part sort of a generic car if you willabout seven years ago we started doing it for a generic ev using uh you know model three x uh model three y i should say um as sort of a coreso we havent done it physicallyweve done it sort of virtually um its you know it its trying to estimate understand different component costs uh of vehicleand right now uh on a generic vehicle youre probably looking about a $10000 ev hickey on a bill of material versus an ice vehicletesla probably somewhere you know probably 50 to 60% of that so theyre theyre much further along than than than other folksall things tesla future of tesla maybe future of tesla stockhaving a really fun chat uh on all things tesla cyber cabsso they have this event elon holds this eventwe saw something it was a car it wasnt something drive by itself went to a destinationa are you a big believer that this country going to be filled with cyber cabsso i think autonomy i something that uh far more important than people are are are realizingum theres simple side of this which robo taxi fleets that i think cyber cab will prob probably play an important role but to be aaa selfish uh new york centric new yorker uh which ive been for my entire lifeum you know weve done a lot of analysis ooo on new york city theres a little over 13000 yellow cabs here uh new york city they drive about a billion miles a year rightso if you think that you can get your cost per mile lower than them or a human driver thats you know less than a buck a mile i think you i would be happy to pay two bucks a milei mean you know co cost of moving around new york city incredibly high youre going very slowum but you know but if you could take that down undercut um you know taxis ubers lyft dramatically you could have a huge business modeli mean whether you pick 2345 bucks each dollar above a dollar $1so if you do $2 youre doing a billion dollar a year a yearum around four oclock afternoon late evening outer boroughs rightbeing a you know a kid from outer boroughs um you know there a need for transportation thereso if you could go out you could say listen im gonna help you with your underserved community that a hard time getting to work getting their kids to school im gonna charge them two bucks a mile which a very efficient way low cost way to get peopleuh around theres a huge opportunity major citiesthats easy parti think more interesting part this something that has not happened uh for almost 100 years speed of traveling vehicles needs to go upand fundamental utility of this industry which most people dont even really think about to get from a to b quicklyand reality that has not changed for better part of last 60 years since 1956 when when we had um uh interstate highway act put place thats when we had um high speed uh travel uh increase or improving dramaticallytake it back even a little bit further to 19 tenswhen uh when model t came into sort of full effect was pumping out of of units a year public transportation really ramped uppeople could move farther faster spread outso thats kind of the precedent if you think about new york city once again to be new york centricuh 1910 population was about 23 million folks as people could move out it dropped to about 16 million following decades has never grown since because people could move out quicklythat was uh that was brought to bear by autos uh public transportation that it hasnt but it hasnt increased since thenso reality autonomy if it successful a vehicle cant hit something elseuh safety level has gone up so dramatically that that speed of travel should be allowed to be increasedand theres kind of this this um sort of ongoing uh sort of governor from from governments that limits your ability to create incremental value for consumerits called speed limiti mean getting a honda accord a mercedes s class youre getting to same place at same amount of ive got a big gas glo over with 500 horsepowerwell if you could drive if you could drive you could drive faster safebut but reality people start spreading out a lot of real estate country that under use could could actually be utilized you could create this great economic growththink about what just happened china over last 10 to 15 yearsalthough economy is slowuh at at moment reality growth auto industry increase of speed of travel for their society drove a significant part of high single digit gdp growthwe wonder why were stuck at 2 to 4% gdp growth hoping for 4% someday uh in in usand reality people cant move around faster fartherin fact actually speed of travel coming down because um because travel uh i going up reality if somebody could travel 50% or 100% as fast or double speed of travel their capacity utilization on road gets cut half it creates more space theres all sorts of things you can do herebut economy i think beyond robo taxi has to be something that thought at sort of federal and state level as to what you can do with it creating dedicated high speed lanes for these high speed vehicleswe have precedent for that on on hhov um really could change dynamics of of um sort of economy society rightthe more people move around see each other they realize theyre not differentum that helps you know from a social perspective as wellso they blow some theres some real opportunity from economic growth structurally societal benefits um that we get off internet and see each otherum that could be a huge benefitso youre looking for over 20% earnings growth for tessa next year 2026 either one of those scenarios that include any type of money from from a a fleet of robo taxis at teslaum implicitly theres a theres a little bit of growth there but basically if we think about sort of earnings uh roundhouse numbers um 22 we were uh at four bucks last year or three bucks this year gonna be about two bucks we go to three four bucks next two yearsyoure not getting a huge lift um until you get into into out years from a cyber a cyber cab fleet i mean 26 when any volume would would come outum so i think it its its kind of more its more out years uh from from a stock perspective when you see a stock kind of bottom out earnings revisions starts you know it starts going up earnings start growingthats usually when stocks start workingso thats um its gonna be an interesting time for stock for next couple of yearsuh this it strikes me as big a big structural change coming to how we live our livesso i i think its a huge challenge to all competitors whether it be fleet managers or o other manufacturersuh i think to your point earlier mary barra doing a great job i think cruise gonna be relatively competitiveum you know other than that one snafu um theyve had other snafus but that bad handling of that of that that accidentum i think theyll theyll be race with them with uh tesla waymoum cruise let me be a couple of other players that that come forits got really you know catch up pretty dramaticallyum i think it means a lot city centers as i as i as i as i mentioned before those companies at least the d two or d three however you wanna define us atlantis these daysum dont play that big in city center so its not an immediate threat to thembut if we get into that world that i just talked about about increasing speed of travel um it gonna it gonna be a real gonna be a real risk for them its something theyre gonna really need to think aboutpeople might need less vehicles people might decide not to share their vehicles have these these personal vehiclesum we could spend hours about uh efficiency of of asset utilization which nowhere near as bad as bears would think its actually uh reasonably efficiently used um asset itselfbut um i think theyre gonna have to do a lot of work catching up in techand i think one thing once again getting back to core of d three they really need to lean back on their truck franchise because thats where they make all their money this cyber worldi dont think youre gonna see a big change uh large pickups probably large large suvsum they might be augmented by this tech but use case there of actually using the trucks for you know business for hauling um thats not gonna change muchare you a big believer tesla monetizing humanoid robotslisten i you know i travel a lot for work if i could have a clone back here uh new york taking care of my kids running around doing a lot of work for meso i i know i do think they all joking aside i do think theres an opportunity there for for that that kind of serviceum i think theres a a question over time with robots on self driving side do you really need to get real a i working or could you uh low cost country source operation of these these uh robots vehicles remote control them for a while at very very low costlisten well listen some of this stuff is happening right nowi mean anything thats um you know its an autonomous vehicle fleet has a uh a god function as as i call it where there are theyre being remote monitored if they get trouble theyre remote driven out of that situationso there um you know there some of that stuff thats going on right nowum listen i think there theres a theres a huge theres a huge opportunity theremenial tasksum you know repetitive tasks can be uh robo robo size if you will o over over timeand i youve seen that a lot of manufacturing plants there ive been plants for more than 25 years theres a lot of r two d two like robots like carrying parts you know a lot of it does exist you dont need it necessarily to be humanoidso the humanoid side of this um for optimists is a bit intriguing that i think would get involved into involved peoples sort of daily lives as opposed to manufacturing because i dont believe that you really need the humanoid robots um quite same wayum you do as existing robots in plants to to manufacture 10 years from nowyou know i think theyll be very theyre very significant multiple streams outside of autoi if you will i mean i you know i think uh optimists and whatever derivatives are uh are probably a big part of it energy storage which we didnt talk about which a little bit outside of the wheelhouse for a dumb auto analysts like myselfum but i still like talking about like whats solar cityi dont knowwell so theres solar city but then theres the storage sort of flow off of what youre doing with batteries and managing to just for like a 24 minute convo on batterieswell yeah theres theres theres lots of stuff there we have a great analyst june hoe who helps us out with that because im not battery chemistry analystum so i think as as as you know as you look at this you you have robots you have energy storage you got a you know auto core then you have auto uh a autonomousum youll have you know many other things that did get developed out of out of tesla over timethat sort of you know its elons launching padum theyre trading generating billions of dollars of capital to to fund it you know ma two minutes we have leftum this obviously not a political po um podcastit not really not what we do herebut if elon if there a change white house president trump wins elon goes to run do or department of government efficient like who his number two who who runs who runs teslaum you know i think lan will be forever uh in intertwined in teslaum i dont think theres um really a uh a number two that i would i would point to that uh would would replace him or or really could replace himso i think he will still be heavily involved with with with companyum i just dont think theres a theres a day where he where he wont be involvedum you know to other side of equation of of opportunity you said of elon getting involved in government you could um run national regulations on on autonomy which i i agree with him actually could be very interesting because then we could have more we drive faster developing it save timeum which you know i mean you know average person spends 7 to 8 years of their life a a vehicleso if you cut that half you 3 to 4 years 35 to 4 years much like you pay a lot of money for that kind of stuff like thatyou know i mean thats you know a lot better than an s class if you get something that could actually you know drive that fastum but i mean i think there there are real things that um could be very interesting from a from a federal standpoint um that he that he could get involved inand i think thing we have to remember about this industry there are a lot of geopolitical um implications for auto industryum we saved uh gm chrysler out of bankruptcy or ran them through bankruptcy i 0809 for a reason to save jobs but also save industrial manufacturing baseand also because it how we all get aroundum you know its wildly more important than i think people really give it credit for they often like to malign it as a dirty emissions generating you know bad industryand reality the public good that created by this industry is pretty wildfollow this guys workhe made auto automotive hall of fame last year righti mean its not often you get to talk to a guy like john murphy covering tessaappreciate your timealways love talking to b of a bank of america senior auto analyst john murphyand thats it for latest episode opening bid uh opening biduh like us on youtube

215,2024-10-24,aktuell tesla erfreut brse mit q3-konferenz - elektroauto f¬r 25000 dollar nur als robotaxi,am mittwoch sorgte schon die verffentlichung des q3-geschftsberichts von tesla mitsamt kurzem ausblick f¬r gewinne der aktie von bis zu 10 prozent im nachbrslichen handel und whrend der anschlieenden telefon-konferenz ging es noch weiter aufwrts denn ceo elon musk zeigte sich nicht nur gewohnt zuversichtlich mit blick auf autonomes fahren sondern gab auch eine konkrete prognose f¬r hhere elektroauto-verkufe im nchsten jahr ab zu den eigenen batterien im 4680-format hatte er weitere positive nachrichten ebenso wie zur produktion des industrie-speichers megapack zudem besttigte musk billigere elektroautos von tesla ab dem ersten halbjahr 2025aus dem kurz nach us-brsenschluss verffentlichten bericht geht hervor dass tesla q3 2024 mit 072 dollar pro aktie deutlich mehr gewinn gemacht hat als im vorfeld erwartet anteil daran hatte die deutliche senkung der durchschnittskosten pro elektroauto auf 35100 dollar das niedrigste niveau das je erreicht wurde auerdem halfen hohe einnahmen aus dem verkauf von co2-guthaben - insgesamt hat tesla damit 2024 bereits gut 2 milliarden dollar eingenommen mehr als im gesamten vorjahr zudem schrieb das unternehmen diesem jahr leichtes wachstum bei den elektroauto-auslieferungen erreichen zu knnen daf¬r wre im vierten quartal ein allzeit-rekord erforderlichzu den erwarteten verkufen im kommenden jahr steht nichts dem bericht doch dazu uerte sich der anschlieenden konferenz mit analysten ceo musk mit ein bisschen risiko wolle er als grobe schtzung 20-30 prozent zunahme der auslieferungen nennen erklrte er das ist deutlich mehr als analysten zuletzt von tesla erwarteten vor der q3-verffentlichung betrug ihre mittlere prognose knapp unter 18 millionen verkaufte elektroautos im kommenden jahr also sogar etwas weniger als 2023 mit 1808 millionen und falls tesla die optimistische prognose im neuen q3-bericht einhlt vielleicht auch 2024f¬r musk und sein unternehmen liege die zukunft k¬nstlicher intelligenz doch am mittwoch sei es um margen und die aussichten im verkauf gegangen mit denen tesla selbst optimistische erwartungen ¬bertroffen habe schrieb nach der konferenz der analyst dan ives von wedbush securities auf x beides sei musik den ohren von tesla-bullen die viel beachtete gewinn-marge ohne den verkauf von co2-guthaben war zuvor viele quartale lang auf zuletzt 146 prozent gesunken bevor tesla jetzt mit einem wert von gut 17 prozent q3 2024 ¬berraschte f¬r ives hat das unternehmen damit das schlimmste hinter sich - auch wenn finanzvorstand vaibhav taneja sagte es werde schwierig diesen wert q4 zu haltengute nachrichten gab es am spten mittwoch auch zum thema stationre speicher f¬r das laufende jahr sagte tesla seinem q3-bericht eine verdoppelung der neu installierten kapazitt voraus wie musk dann ergnzte hat die spezielle megapack-fabrik kalifornien mit 200 einheiten pro woche mittlerweile die zielrate von 40 gigawattstunden produktion pro jahr erreicht die spter begonnene tesla-megafactory china soll nach seinen worten im ersten quartal 2025 betrieb gehen damit werde es nicht mehr lange dauern bis tesla 100 gigawattstunden speicher pro jahr verkaufen werde -

und k¬ndigte ein kostenloses upgrade f¬r den fall an dass sich hw3 tatschlich als zu schwach erweisen sollteim vorfeld der q3-informationen konnten anleger fragen einreichen die das management beantworten sollte und auch dieses mal gingen musk und sein f¬hrungsteam auf die populrsten vorschlge ein diese betrafen vor allem das zuk¬nftige elektroauto-programm von tesla einem fall explizit mit der ergnzung dass ein normales nicht-robotaxi zum preis von 25000 dollar gemeint sei alle unsere fahrzeuge sind heute robotaxis antwortete darauf der technische fahrzeug-leiter lars moravy und musk ergnzte von den bislang 7 millionen produzierten teslas eigne sich die ¬berwltigende mehrzahl f¬r autonomes fahrenals robotaxi scheint tesla damit jetzt seine aktuellen und fr¬heren elektroautos zu bezeichnen whrend sich f¬r das vor zwei wochen gezeigte modell ganz ohne pedale und lenkrad der name cybercab etabliert dazu sagte musk am mittwoch wie zuvor dieser tesla werde 2026 die produktion gehen - damit sei aber bereits eine serienproduktion gemeint nicht nur der auftakt ergnzte er jetzt auf lngere sicht plane tesla mindestens 2 millionen einheiten pro jahr mehr als einer fabrik noch spter vielleicht sogar vier millionen das cybercab werde eine revolution der produktion bringen sodass konkurrenten nicht mehr derselben liga wie tesla spielen w¬rdender neue produktionsprozess war nach tesla-angaben von anfang 2023 zunchst f¬r ein konventionelleres elektroauto unterhalb von model 3 und model y vorgesehen das im zweiten halbjahr 2025 auf den markt kommen sollte diesem april hie es tesla habe diesen plan zugunsten des reinen robotaxis aufgegeben was musk ohne details als gelogen bezeichnete als antwort auf die anleger-frage sagte er jedoch jetzt es habe keinen sinn ein normales elektroauto f¬r 25000 dollar anzubietendas cybercab sei optimiert f¬r autonomes fahren und koste ungefhr 25000 dollar erklrte der tesla-chef dazu abweichend von seiner angabe von 30000 dollar nach abzug von kufer-anreizen derselben konferenz wer wolle knne eines kaufen und f¬r sich allein nutzen es werde eben nur keine pedale und kein lenkrad haben nach fr¬heren berichten sollten ein rein autonomer und der bislang bezahlbarste tesla auf derselben neuen plattform basieren die neuen musk-aussagen hrten sich nicht danach an dass ein cybercab-ableger geplant ist der auch normal gefahren werden kannoffen blieb dabei was tesla mit den bezahlbareren elektroautos ab dem ersten halbjahr 2025 meint die erstmals im bericht f¬r q1 2024 und jetzt erneut erwhnt wurden ebenfalls im plural sagte musk am mittwoch man sei damit weiterhin im plan angesichts des nahen starttermins wre der offensichtlichste kandidat daf¬r das model y f¬r das tesla laut berichten anfang 2025 eine auffrischung unter dem code-namen juniper plant abhngig davon wie umfangreich die neuerungen ausfallen knnte man dann tatschlich von einem neuen elektroauto sprechen und die bereits deutlich gesunkenen produktionskosten q3 2024 sowie 4680-fortschritte knnten tesla erlauben den startpreis f¬r das model y juniper zumindest deutlich nher an die viel zitierten 25000 dollar zu bringen,0.188636,positive
216,2024-11-14,trumps victory could ease regulatory path for musks robotaxi but hurdles remain,tesla currently faces a diverse landscape of state driverless-vehicle laws that musk blasted an oct 23 earnings call calling it incredibly painful to do it state-by-state he signaled he would advocate for one federal approval process if trump won followed through on a promise to name musk efficiency czarif theres a department of government efficiency musk said ill try to help make that happenon tuesday trump tapped musk another ally to lead such an entity which not a government agency it remains unclear how organization will functionmusks sway likely to extend beyond efficiency billionaire who gave at least $119 million to a pro-trump group during campaign expected to influence president-elects pick for next transportation department secretary according to a person close to musk trumps transition planning that department which includes national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) regulates automakers could push through significant changes to self-driving rules at a national levelbut even if musk secures favorable regulation tesla would still face steep technological legal hurdles deploying driverless vehicles along with questions over how to insure them according to reuters interviews with nine regulatory legal experts a review of us state driverless-vehicle lawstesla musk did not respond to reuters requests for commentat present tesla remains years behind rivals california by far carmakers largest us market a primary testing ground for autonomous-vehicle industry other companies have navigated californias regulatory maze completed millions of autonomous-vehicle testing miles under state oversight according to a reuters review of

near ready to be a robotaximusk says self-driving teslas will be ready next year echoing unfulfilled promises dating back about a decade he has increasingly bet teslas future on robotaxis since this spring when reuters reported automaker had scrapped plans for a mass-market affordable car for human drivers amid softening electric-vehicle demand rising competition from cheap chinese evshe told

milestesla has lobbied for electric vehicle subsidies other benefits over yearsthe company for years has also supported a federal standard for autonomous driving discussions with congress nhtsa but was unable to get one place part because of a divided congress said two people familiar with companys strategy tesla 2018 signed a letter supporting a senate bill that would have preempted some state regulation of autonomous vehicles but legislation never got a full senate votein recent months musk has emerged as a prominent member of trumps inner circlehe spent election night at trumps florida mar-a-lago club has frequented luxury compound since former presidents nov 5 victory according to sources videos posted by republican operativesmusk has attended at least one meeting at mar-a-lago about appointment of a senior cabinet position treasury secretary according to a second person familiar with mattera trump spokesperson did not answer questions about autonomous driving regulations or musks influence but said our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas efficiencyunder a trump administration nhtsa could design accommodating autonomous-vehicle standards but a key question would be whether regulator could or would prevent states from passing their own stricter rules three legal regulatory experts told reutersa republican-controlled congress also could enact a national approval process that supersedes state laws nhtsa has traditionally regulated design of vehicles while states primarily regulate drivers set traffic laws -- a split that isnt clear once car itself becomes driver bryant walker smith a university of south carolina law professor who focuses on autonomous driving said nhtsa could interpret its authority more broadly if it was being directed to achieve a certain political outcomeunder trump nhtsa could clear path for more novel designs like that of cybercab which musk says will have no steering wheel or pedalsnational autonomous-vehicle regulation more important to tesla than its rivals because tesla has a different business model musks strategy involves selling millions of vehicles that can drive themselves anywhere on earth almost all other competitors including waymo operate robotaxi fleets limited comprehensively mapped zones of specific citieswaymo others build more expensive robotaxis that are equipped with suites of redundant technologies sensors including radar lidar which uses lasers to detect objects create three-dimensional images of a vehicles surroundings tesla relies solely on computer vision which seeks to use cameras like humans use eyes with artificial intelligence that translates images into driving decisionsasked on a july earnings call how he would overcome regulatory challenges musk said tesla would have billions of miles showing fsd safer than a human driver that regulators would be morally obligated to approvebut tesla so far has little to show regulators california department of motor vehicles told reuters tesla had not sought driverless-testing or deployment permits required to operate driverless vehicles on public roads california would be critical to any rollout of what musk calls a tesla robotaxi network which he has said could offer rides both tesla- customer-owned taxis about 37% of all teslas on us roads are california according to industry data provider experian automotivewaymo now only company with california approval to charge passengers for rides driverless taxis it wasnt easywaymo first secured a permit 2014 to test with a safety driver it got a driverless-testing permit four years later october 2018 after logging more than 22 million test miles it took three more years 37 million more testing miles to secure approval from california dmv to commercially operate autonomous vehicles -- with a human driver onboard -- san francisco parts of san mateo county waymo logged another 74 million miles before winning approval august 2023 to charge customers for rides driverless robotaxis san francisco state records show waymo also currently operates los angeles phoenixgms cruise also operated driverless-taxis san francisco but had its permit suspended after an october 2023 incident where a cruise vehicle dragged a pedestrian who had been hit by another car for 20 feetless regulation more legal risktesla faces different but still-difficult challenges less-regulated states including texas which has almost no restrictions specifically forbids cities from regulating driverless vehiclesbut tesla would face immense legal liability for crashes moment it claims its vehicles are fully autonomous automaker has until now blamed tesla drivers defending itself against lawsuits regulatory investigations over accidents involving fsd autopilot tesla argues it warns drivers to pay attention because those systems arent fully autonomousif tesla felt comfortable deploying self-driving technology low-regulation states like texas then presumably they would be doing it said smith university of south carolina law professor but once you say there no need for a human to pay attention then youre pointing finger back at yourself when it comes to crash liabilityinsuring driverless teslas would be another major challenge individual consumers cant currently buy a fully autonomous vehicle -- so no insurance for one exists said bob

require vehicles to be able to pull safely off road if they encounter problems fifteen of 50 us states have no laws specific to driverless-vehicles according to autonomous vehicle industry association a trade grouplight or nonexistent regulations could heighten legal risk because autonomous-vehicle companies couldnt argue they complied with strict government safety standards said three experts autonomous-driving law californias tougher regulations help protect companies securing approvals which could provide powerful evidence for a defense if permitted firms get sued over crashes said

like direct bribery of officers of law - are not a common a occurrence cultures of these advanced democraciesbut this does not mean there no corruption these societies its just revealed different ways or hidden behind certain levels of gentility tradition nations that score high on absence of corruption indices may have rid themselves of certain forms of direct bribery but when toyota speaks japan listens; or when new us exhaust rules are up for debate polluters like big oil auto ask for more pollution those exhaust rules get softened despite opposition from doctors nurses scientists public interest groups many businesses general publicand then of course there are various court-blessed forms of bribery election tampering which well were going to see a couple examples of a few momentsthough perhaps those customs of gentility are showing some cracks these days as us stock market has openly been rewarding teslas stock price all week (until today its first down day a week) not due to any changes company performance or even any beneficial changes policy (in fact prospective policy changes are likely damaging to teslas mission product categories not helpful) but rather due to stock markets seemingly open desire to see tesla benefit from direct government corruptionthe market does have reason to think this too convicted felon donald trump next man who will squat white house after finally winning more votes than his opponent on his third try (and after committing treason 2021 for which there one clear constitutional remedy) has displayed open corruption at many points pastthis legacy of corruption well-chronicled easily seen by anyone who has paid any attention that said scope of it with over 3700 conflicts of interest displayed during his first stint as pretender to throne might still surprise even those who have closely followed ridiculousness of mans existencenevertheless ceo of nations largest ev maker has attempted to pair up with felon question pledging hundreds of millions of dollars he got from selling evs to fund a candidate who promised to tank evs if oil companies gave him a billion-dollar bribemusk despite previously correctly acknowledging that climate change real leaving [the paris agreement] not good for america or world has forgotten anything he might have known about climate change has buddied up to someone whose last occupation of white house whose partys recent actions have been marked by several moves aimed towards poisoning americans with more air water pollution saddling everyone with higher health fuel costsin addition mr trump has shown total ignorance (well theres a phrase you surely havent heard last microsecond) of everything related to evs ev-related policy his running-mate even wrote a bill to increase ev prices by $15000 compared to polluting gas vehiclesfurther those his orbit have indicated they want other changes that likely conflict with teslas business model - for example first car dealer elected to senate wants to change car dealership rules probably not benefit of tesla which has aligned itself directly against car dealership modelthis at first glance seems incongruous (also at second glance several more after) its strange that stock market would react to a vote of confidence a confidence-man who clearly intends to be bad for evs by rewarding a company whose stated mission to accelerate adoption of evsbut wait there perhaps an explanation for this if youve been paying any amount of attention at all (a luxury which 74 million americans seem incapable of) i bet you know what it isits corruptionindeed stock market has decided that recent situationship between these two individuals - who both have such a void their hearts that theyve wasted billions of dollars of their (and other peoples) money on social media companies order to feel loved - somehow real going to flourish into a beautiful corruption-laden baby form of tesla somehow being uniquely advantaged by a close relationship with federal governmentwhat were talking about here a public consensus that tesla company whose market cap has spiked more than any other over course of past week going to uniquely benefit from corruption that it will gain due to personal relationship described above thats why tsla went up so much past weekits not because cybercab driving on well-mapped private roads like we already knew it can its not because theyre having trouble selling cybertrucks its not because teslas mexican factory plans have been thrown into question its not because theyll get 50 cents or whatever every time a volvo charges at a superchargerits because tsla buyers a country that has publicly prided itself on being a bastion of economic freedom from a party campaign that has claimed for so long to support these ideals think mr trump republicans will do some good ol big-government corruption they want to benefit from it some analysts have attempted to come up with any number of other urbane explanations to hide their cheerleading for this corruption but occams razor leads us to obvious answer as to whats happening herewe dont actually know what sort of corruption could occur here to benefit tesla or what market anticipating as mentioned above likely policy changes would all be bad for evs solar which are only two businesses tesla has ever made money inalready today a new epa pick has been announced who has already signaled an intent to destroy environmental economic progress made under current epa he has repeatedly attacked clean air over his legislative historysome have theorized that a new government would end various legal actions against tesla that this would benefit companyhowever most significant legal actions against tesla are not on federal level are state-level actions or class actions not ones led by government federal government currently undergoing no significant legal actions against tesla except typical safety-related nhtsa investigations which every automaker sees arent likely to result sweeping changes for teslaand even if white house did try to illegally intervene non-federal actions (and when you vote for a criminal you can indeed expect him to do crime) - like case over musks illegal pay package - this specific one would help tesla by saving company from wasting $55 billion on a bad ceoeven tsla cheerleader adam jonas noted difficulty understanding how this potential closeness would benefit tesla a note sent out yesterdayso again it not clear what sort of corruption tsla gamblers think company would benefit from but message from stock market clear thats what it wantsall of this comes against a backdrop of last 4 years of government policy that has benefitted tesla greatly tesla originally started business a heavily democratic state with support from that states regulations aimed towards putting zero emission vehicles on roadthe company applied for earned early loans from president obamas democratic federal government which helped it get started benefitted from obamas epa finally harmonizing regulations with california a smoother regulatory environment which mr trump later torpedoed it also received more benefit from first round of federal tax credits than any other companyand biden-harris administration has again greatly benefitted tesla by improving federal tax credit which tesla has again used more than any other automaker epa has made a number of positive actions last four years which tesla has lobbied for which tesla will benefit from (in contrast to mr trumps actions which tesla lobbied against which harmed tesla)even nacs transition was sparked by biden because federal rules requiring intercompatibility as a qualification for receiving charging grants what led tesla to introduce standard to begin with company will likely benefit from this though recent chaos caused by mercurial actions of its bad ceo have put a damper on thatunlike investors apparent desires from incoming regime these actions were not corruptly targeted towards an individual company on basis of personal gain or perceived friendship but towards public good tesla just happened to be biggest company building a product that helps make transportation cleaner thus benefitted mostso again whiplash here of a positive stock response to negative news confusing unless we explain it as corruptionnow there are still reasons to think that this might not turn out as well as this weeks gamblers might thinkafter all both individuals are known for their capriciousness for turnover increasing closer you get to them their respective organizations for those theyve worked closely with speaking out against them for their habit of firing high-performers who deign to present ideas - no matter how reasonable - if those ideas happen to be opposition to whatever each respective egomaniacs current fixation isalways a sign of a great leader if their closest team members keep quitting - surely two leaders of that sort are even more likely to work well together rightbut whether it works out or not let us call all of this exactly what it stock market actively openly betting on corruption (and not just with tesla - this week crypto markets have been going crazy expecting that a scammer white house will benefit an asset class that exists solely to facilitate scams) it hopes for a handout hopes for exemptions carveouts hopes for government to pick winners losers (remember when republican candidate made that statement about tesla specifically)this not a group of people that support properly working markets competition or any of ideals they often profess they are instead expecting advocating for corruption its kind of thing thats more appropriate for a banana republic(an) not one of those aforementioned advanced democracies which we used to be able to consider ourselves one of,0.0826839,positive

camras peut avoir du mal ÿ voir si la route nest pas bien claire cependant la route sur laquelle roulait paul semblait suffisamment claire par les phares de la voiture lectrique les choses se gtent

220,2024-10-30,future predictions of nikola tesla that will surprise you,nikola tesla (1856-1943) was a serbian-american engineer he also famous as a futurist an inventor we know today him for his contributions to design of modern alternating current (ac) electricity supply system however future predictions of nicola tesla became uncannily true years later many inventions everyday life that we take for granted tesla predicted at turn of 20th century let us now explore some of his predictions on various spheres like wifi wireless power transmission driverless cars robots thought cameras etctesla predicted concept of wireless communication long before it became a reality he envisioned a world where people could communicate without wires a notion that laid groundwork for modern wi-fi technologypresent wireless receiving apparatus will be scrapped for much simpler machines; static all forms of interference will be eliminated so that innumerable transmitters receivers may be operated without interference it more than probable that households daily newspaper will be printed wirelessly home at night domestic management -- problems of heat light household mechanics -- will be freed from all labor through beneficent wireless powerhe famously statedtesla foresaw development of autonomous vehicles predicting that cars would eventually drive themselves he envisioned a future where human intervention would be minimal with machines taking over navigation controlas early as 1898 i proposed to representatives of a large manufacturing concern construction public exhibition of an automobile carriage which left to itself would perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to judgmenttesla statedthis notion hints at a future where vehicles could communicate with one another optimizing travel reducing accidents today companies like tesla waymo others are developing advanced self-driving technology moving closer to realizing teslas predictiontesla pioneered concept of wireless energy transfer he believed that we could transmit electricity without wires he demonstrated this idea through numerous experiments famously said an interview with colliers magazinewhen we commercialize wireless power transmission it will revolutionize transport transmission we have already transmitted motion pictures wirelessly over a short distance later distance will be illimitable by later i mean only a few years hence wires transmit pictures they were successfully telegraphed using point system thirty years ago when wireless power transmission becomes widespread these methods will seem as crude as steam locomotive compared to electric trainnicola teslarecent developments wireless energy transfer such as inductive charging for electric vehicles smartphones illustrate teslas groundbreaking ideas coming to fruitionteslas predictions extended to health diet emphasizing importance of nutrition for physical mental well-being consequently he developed strange theories about optimal human diet besides he dined on little more than milk honey his final days believing that this was purest form of foodmore people die or grow sick from polluted water than from coffee tea tobacco other stimulants i eschew all stimulants there will be enough wheat wheat products to feed entire world including teeming millions of china indiatesla statedteslas vision for a sustainable future included protection of environment his predictions hinted at necessity for regulatory bodies to oversee environmental protection although tesla did not live to see establishment of environmental protection agency (epa) 1970 his ideas about conservation environmental stewardship resonate with agencys missionhygiene physical culture will be recognized branches of education government secretary of hygiene or physical culture will be far more important cabinet of president of united states who holds office year 2035 than secretary of war pollution of our beaches such as exists today around new york city will seem as unthinkable to our children grandchildren as life without plumbing seems to us our water supply will be far more carefully supervised only a lunatic will drink unsterilized watertesla statedtesla anticipated rise of robotics automation long before it became commonplace he envisioned machines taking over mundane tasks freeing humans for more creative pursuitsinnumerable activities still performed by human hands today will be performed by automatons at this very moment scientists working laboratories of american universities are attempting to create what has been described as a  thinking machine i anticipated this development i constructed  robots today robot an accepted fact but principle has not been pushed far enough twenty-first century robot will take place that slave labor occupied ancient civilizations there no reason at all why most of this should not come to pass less than a century freeing mankind to pursue its higher aspirationstesla statedteslas concept of a death ray reflected his concerns about destructive potential of technology he believed that powerful energy could be harnessed for defense but warned against its misuse consequently he worked on a particle beam weapon later years of his life that he hoped would end all wars it would be so powerful that it would easily destroy anything enemy would throw your way even hundreds of miles away hence if every country had such a weapon war would be meaningless while he did not build ray(and plans for it were mysteriously lost) concept of mutually assured description was cornerstone of cold warin context of modern military technology teslas fears about mutually assured destruction resonate todaytesla envisioned a thought camera which many interpret as an early conceptualization of technologies like mri (magnetic resonance imaging) he believed possibility of capturing human thoughts emotions through advanced technology hence a 1933 interview tesla said followingi expect to photograph thoughts 1893 while conducting certain investigations i became convinced that a definite image formed thought must by reflex action produce a corresponding image on retina which a suitable apparatus could read if it true that a thought reflects an image on retina we need only illuminate that property take photographs then use ordinary methods to project image onto a screen if done successfully this process would reflect objects imagined by a person on screen as they form allowing us to read every thought of individualtesla famously predicted emergence of flying cars envisioning a future where air travel would become as common as driving he believed that technological advancements would make personal flying vehicles a realityi foresee development of flying machine exceeding that of automobile i expect mr ford to make large contributions toward this progress problem of parking automobiles furnishing separate roads for commercial pleasure traffic will be solved belted parking towers will arise our large cities roads will be multiplied through sheer necessity or finally rendered

perfectly happy to see it gopresident-elect donald trump reportedly planning to nix $7500 tax credit for ev buyers early into his administration a move that could deeply harm certain legacy automakers reuters first reported plan on thursdaytesla however would be poised to benefits since those plans would hurt its rivals while maintaining its dominance american market possibly even expanding its lead over competitors tesla only automaker making a profit on its ev sales us legacy automakers like general motor ford are losing money on ev sales because they sell only a fraction of teslas volume are yet to achieve economies of scale with their electric product lines that tesla has masteredmusk one of trumps most prominent backers a new member of trump administration has said that eliminating tax credits could be slightly bad for his company but that long term move probably actually helps teslabut why would ending a credit that incentivizes americans to buy evs be good for one company not otherstesla having released its first car 2008 has had longer than other companies to benefit from government subsidies that were created to encourage development of electric vehiclesin 2010 tesla received a $465 million loan from department of energy to produce electric vehicles to develop a manufacturing facility fremont california loan was paid off 2013 company also benefitted from nearly $3 billion from credits offered to ev buyers according to subsidy tracks database which tracks subsidies from 2000 to todaytake away subsidies it will only help tesla musk who was recently tapped to serve as co-chair of trumps new department of government efficiency wrote on x formerly twitter july also remove subsidies from all industriesthe rest of industry disagreesin a friday press release shared with newsweek mike murphy founder ceo of american ev jobs alliance said group would vocally oppose efforts to repeal obama or biden-era ev policies adding that it would be misguided for an incoming trump administration to do so ironic given that much of new spending field happens to be red statesthis very unfortunate news for american consumers autoworkers who are benefitting from $188 billion surge new manufacturing capacity us to design manufacture vehicles of future to compete globally murphy said this means lost jobs more pollution a strategic advantage to our competitors a rapidly growing chinese automotive industrythe alliance for automative innovation an industry group representing ford gm honda toyota others also urged congress to keep tax credits an october letter that called rebate critical to cementing us as a global leader future of automotive technology manufacturingwith that head start tesla has been able to soar ahead of other competitors its market lead so unshakable that even though an end to tax credits would bring down price of all evs tesla would only see its profits reduced teslas rivals on other hand would watch profits shrink while also reporting increased losses making it even harder for them to enter market compete industrys pricing wartesla has a significant advantage over most automakers terms of manufacturing efficiency scale which gives its vehicles higher profit margins greater resilience to removing tax credit paul waatti a manager at autopacifics product analysis told newsweekin third quarter of 2024 tesla reported a pre-tax profit margin of 18 percent double industry average of 9 percent high earnings are coming even as teslas vehicles are priced significantly lower than rival evs its most affordable car model 3 more than $14000 cheaper than average ev according to data from kelly blue bookof nearly 600000s evs sold us during first two quarters of 2023 nearly half were made by tesla while just over 7 percent were made by ford manufacturer with second-highest number of ev saleslegacy automakers are simultaneously tasked with maintaining ice [internal combustion engines] portfolios scaling a new ev business where profitability already scarce relying more on subsidies to make business case pencil waatti saidto respond to those new losses teslas competitors may need to further pull back ev production to shift their focus back on ice products meaning less competition for musk another edge up ev pricing war his company waged after drastically slashing prices last yeartesla which was forced to cut prices of its vehicles when an earlier version of tax credit phased out 2019 probably would not have to do same as other ev makerseven after report of trumps proposed tax cut sent down shares of tesla other automakers musks 715 million shares options to buy tesla stock are still worth $427 billion more than than where they closed on election day tesla shares closed down 7 percent this week while rivian shares fell 5 percentwhat are ev tax creditsas part of his administrations goal of having 50 percent of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030 president joe biden signed expansive inflation reduction act into law august 2022 that included up to $7500 rebates for americans who purchase new electric vehicles for next decade law went into effect january 1 2023still as of april 2023 those tax credits were only available for 14 models of electric cars trucks about 15 percent of vehicles available for americans to purchase administration expanded list of qualifying vehicles to include at least 38 ev modelsthe biden white house said a january fact sheet that ev sales have more than quadrupled since biden took office bringing total number of evs on road to more than 45 million cars white house also said president had made evs more affordable with prices down 20 percent from last year charging more accessible with publicly available ports growing by over 70 percentwithout federal support growth of ev infrastructure us such as charging stations might slow affecting evs overall feasibility attractiveness to consumers waati saidwhat has elon musk said about tax creditsmusk however has long held that tesla doesnt need federal rebates or charging supportasked about bidens infrastructure plan 2021 musk told wall street journal honestly i would just can this whole bill dont pass it thats my recommendation he also called federal support for more charging stations unnecessary pushed government to get rid of subsidies for oil gas as wellwhen we started tesla there were no ev subsidies gasoline was super cheap musk said during wsjs ceo council summit we did not anticipate any subsidies that came later $7500 tax credit came as a result not of tesla activity but of general motors lobbying for ittesla cfo vaibhav taneja echoed his boss position during a july earnings call noting that while company has taken advantage of federal support we always drive ourselves to say ok what if there no ira benefit how do we operate that kind of an environment like elon said we definitely have a big advantage as compared to our competition on that frontduring his campaign trump repeatedly vowed to kill what he called bidens ev mandate no such mandate exists federal law yet last year tesla lobbied government for same regulations that that political right has blasted a filing with environmental protection agency (epa) tesla said outright that an end to manufacture of gasoline cars was essential to address rapidly escalating climate crisiselon tends to say hes hostile to subsidies while tesla gobbling them up like a hungry godzilla murphy told cnbc augustand though musk trump are close now there was a time musk was critical of trumps climate change actions or lack thereof tesla ceo quit trump white houses advisory panels five months into republicans first term after administration withdrew from paris agreement which musk said at time not good for america or worlddo us consumers want ev tax creditsabout six months after $7500 credit was signed into law only 8 percent of us adults said they or someone else their household owns or leases an evthe poll conducted by associated press-norc center for public affairs research energy policy institute at university of chicago february 2023 found that only 4 10 said they would be at least somewhat likely to buy an electric model next time they buy a carmore than a a year later americans were unmoved pollsters june 2024 survey showed that number of americans willing to go electric remained same share of people who said they or someone else their household owns or leases an ev went up a single point to 9 percentit also seems like many consumers just might not be aware it existsa bluelab analytics poll conducted august 2023 -- a year after federal subsidies wee signed into law -- showed that there were still 40 percent of americans who did not know about ev tax credit only 22 percent said they knew a great deal or a good amount about incentive another 34 percent said they knew a littlewhat about ev mandates set by blue stateseven if trump changes current climate policies place there are 12 democratic-led states that -- beginning with 2026 or 2027 models -- will require 35 percent of new cars to be electric that means ev makers would need to double or triple their sales just one yearthe mandates are part of california air resources boards advanced clean cars regulations that require 100 percent of new vehicle sales california to be zero-emission models by 2035if ev growth stalled meeting state-level zev mandates will also be more challenging for automakers waatti said this likely leads to increased compliance costs for manufacturers potential legal or regulatory conflicts between state federal policiesas of this year none of those states are accordance with carb mandates only state on track to reach that goal california where evs account for 27 percent of new car sales colorado washington evs represent 22 percent 20 percent of new retail sales respectively other states lag much further behind evs represent just 9 percent 5 percent of cars sold rhode island new mexico respectively this yearjack hollis president of toyota motor north america said last week that it looks impossible to meet california-led mandates during a virtual roundtable he said it would be unnatural to funnel more evs into an unwelcoming market ultimately limit[ing] a customers choice of vehicles they wantits going to distort industry its going to distort business why because its unnatural to what current demand marketplace hollis saidthe longtime auto executive said toyota would prefer a single national standard across all 50 states so that we can treat all customers all

wasserschutzgebiet gelegenen fabrik warnt wie weit verbreitet die vorbehalte gegen tesla der bevlkerung sind wurde bei einer einwohnerbefragung im februar deutlich als sich zwei drittel der teilnehmer gr¬nheide gegen die erweiterungsplne von tesla ausgesprochen hattenin den vergangenen monaten hat die b¬rgerinitiative auch zunehmend unterst¬tzung von umweltaktivisten aus ¬berregionalen und internationalen netzwerken erhalten die einem protestcamp nahe der fabrik nicht nur gegen die erweiterungsplne f¬r die fabrik gr¬nheide protestieren sondern gegen tesla und elon musk als reprsentanten eines gr¬nen kapitalismus zu felde ziehen den sie grundstzlich ablehnen auch linksradikale gruppen nutzten die aufmerksamkeit die jede schlagzeile zu tesla und elon musk nach sich zieht und bekannten sich zu einem anschlag auf die stromversorgung der fabrik gr¬nheide die die produktion anfang mrz f¬r mehrere tage stilllegtedie intensitt der proteste ist nicht vergleichbar mit hnlichen ansiedlungen und die beschleunigung des projektes wirkt sicher als ein trigger sagt k¬hn ¬ber die widerstnde die die ansiedlung von tesla den vergangenen jahren hervorgerufen hat das tesla-tempo das die behrden im genehmigungsverfahren angeschlagen haben sei nicht zuletzt auf kosten einer beteiligung der bevlkerung gegangen der schnelle baufortschritt der mit vorabzulassungen ermglicht wurde habe den eindruck erweckt dass fakten geschaffen werden ohne die einwnde der bevlkerung zu ber¬cksichtigendie planungsverfahren htten nicht zu einer befriedung der konflikte beigetragen sondern die gegnerschaft der beteiligten vertieft und emotionalisiert weil eine offene debatte und ein von allen seiten akzeptiertes verfahren als voraussetzung fehlten die bevlkerung wurde bef¬rworter und gegner gespalten sagt k¬hn zu erleben war das zuletzt bei einer sitzung der gemeindevertretung von gr¬nheide die mitte mai zum ersten mal unter polizeischutz tagte weil der bebauungsplan f¬r eine erweiterung des

234,2024-11-04,swedish labor unions are undaunted by tesla intrasigence,one thing you can say about elon musk that once he gets an idea into his head he doggedly sticks to it against any attempts to change his mind this can be both a blessing a curse there an old expression that says minds are like parachutes -- they only work when they are open whether it a tesla car that can drive from los angeles to new york city park itself a manhattan garage without any human input rockets that fly backwards so they can be reused purchasing twitter or building 10 billion humanoids next decade musk undeterred by any whose thinking differs from his ownusually that means he gets his own way because most people get worn down face of such obstinacy not labor unions sweden for over a year swedish industrial union if metall has been demanding better wages benefits conditions for mechanics tesla repair shops across country it first only strike against tesla anywhere world has now become longest running strike sweden past 100 years april six months into dispute musk said actually i think storm has passed on that front i think things are reasonably good shape sweden that was not true then it not true now guardian reportstesla strike attracts supportsince strike began a year ago other unions have elected to support swedish workers that means shipping of tesla cars to swedish ports has been blocked cleaning of tesla facilities has been halted postal deliveries for tesla -- including new license plates -- to all tesla offices no longer take place connecting new tesla supercharger stations to power grid has been interrupted tesla has repeatedly lost legal battles against these solidarity strikes was recently required to pay sek65m ($607000) legal costs to postnord swedish postal servicetwelve swedish trade unions are involved three nordic ones including norways transport union fellesforbundet 3f transport denmark meanwhile tesla has brought strikebreakers from uk france italy spain finland denmark many other european countries to cover 52 striking workers -- almost half of tesla mechanics sweden while legal under swedish law use of strikebreakers anathema to unions employers alike nordic countries where unwritten rules norms are essential to their model of worker protection tradition of collective agreements between employer employees negotiated via a union strong those countries sweden almost 90% of workforce covered by a collective agreement across all sectors but for tesla this seems to be of little concern to its notoriously anti-union ceo guardian saysfundamentally what at stake swedish labor market model of collective bargaining which musk refuses to recognize determined opposition by if metall stems part from a realization that long standing collective bargaining framework that norm nordic countries could crumble lead to a situation which an employer could simply fire employees way musk did when he got rid of nearly entire supercharger team a fit of pique last spring because head of that group dared to disagree with himbeyond swedenthe dispute about more than license plates janitorial services ig metall one of germanys most powerful unions it wants to represent workers at tesla factory gr¬nheide only tesla factory europe johan jrvklo international secretary of if metall has said its really a global struggle sweden currently at forefront way union sees it allowing tesla to get away without signing an agreement would risk encouraging other employers sweden europe to do same from teslas point of view there concern that saying yes to collective bargaining sweden could be used as leverage by unions other countries where tesla has factories many more employees including united statesalthough concerns expressed by tesla may be understandable they indicate a limited understanding of european industrial relations systems according to guardian joining a union a fundamental right of all swedish workers almost half of tesla mechanics sweden are union members which means by law tesla has to negotiate with union on many issues even if no collective agreement has been signed if metall recently filed a lawsuit against tesla for failing to inform negotiate with union members over workplace changes as required by swedish labor lawin addition some parts of europe collective bargaining agreements with one company an industry or region extend by law to most other companies that industry or region this case austria spain netherlands finland france where firms must comply with extended collective bargaining agreements whether they have signed them or nottesla union agreements francealthough tesla boasts that it has no collective agreement anywhere world german bender author of report for guardian says he has uncovered three local agreements between tesla france largest union france cfdt those agreements are registered on lgifrance official website of french government for publication of legal documents such as collective agreements he says bender chief analyst at progressive swedish think tank arena a senior research associate at harvard law school center for labor a just economy i believe this new discovery could help to resolve swedish stalemate prevent disputes other countries he writes since tesla already has to comply with collective agreements many countries even has local agreements france it would not be setting a precedent if it did same sweden so it should start to see unions as a partner to negotiate with rather than an enemyhe notes that teslas own global human rights policy says conformance with local law tesla respects right of workers to form join trade unions of their own choosing  or to form join other employee representative bodies  to bargain collectively if company operated spirit of this policy it should be perfectly able to adapt to different countries regulations norms prevent this unnecessary strike sweden from continuing any further into its second year bender says he clearly does not understand how elon musk thinksesther lynch general secretary of european trade union confederation said recently musk can make up his own rules when he reaches mars but if you want to do business europe then you need to play by europes rules that means respecting our tradition of collective bargaining ms lynch has also never had an opportunity to have a

236,2024-11-18,tesla full self driving continues to improve exponentially,teslas full self-driving (fsd) software has been a subject of immense curiosity excitement sometimes skepticism yet progress tesla has made developing refining fsd nothing short of remarkable during a panel discussion on hans nelsons youtube channel titled teslas insane fsd progress tesla experts investors hans nelson herbert ong jeff lutz discussed latest fsd advancements shedding light on exponential improvements tesla has achieved challenges that lie aheadtesla has a really good ability to sort real-time issues as they come from drivers said herbert ong he praised companys data-driven approach which has been instrumental refining fsd at an unprecedented pace with version 12521 already deployed to 50000 vehicles ong explained that teslas responsiveness to user feedback has made their software continually better progress really good its interesting to see how quickly theyve addressed things like abrupt stopping at yellow lights or hesitation at green lights -- all things that drivers have been reporting ong addedrecent updates whats nextone of most notable milestones discussed during panel was full rollout of end-to-end highway driving to all ai hardware 4 users which targeted for early next week theyve enhanced stop smoothness reduced annoying weather notifications introduced various safety improvements said jeff lutz version 125x continues to refine city driving smart summon has now been released to europe china other international markets -- a testament to teslas ambition to make their technology globally adaptablehowever ong also touched on elephant room there are some features that were planned for october like unpark park reverse capabilities which havent yet been fully rolled out he emphasized that although tesla fell behind on these particular features sheer scale of we robot event which took place mid-october might have been reason for delay despite some setbacks ong remarked even if all of this gets pushed to december or january bigger picture that these engineering problems have solutions tesla will deliverharnessing data to drive improvementthe role of data cannot be overstated when it comes to teslas fsd improvements amount of information theyre getting from fleet pretty significant lutz said were talking about roughly 50000 vehicles on version 1256 when you have datasets this large it becomes much easier to identify product performance trends real-time he explained that analyzing large data sets crucial for understanding how system performing where it can be improved when youre dealing with millions of data points you get a much clearer picture compared to smaller more discrete datasets lutz addedthis approach to iterative testing data collection enables tesla to identify issues quickly adjust course where necessary which has been a driving factor their progress teslas ability to validate these changes through large-scale data analysis really sets them apart noted onghardware 4 ai4 unleashing new capabilitiesteslas hardware 4 coupled with latest ai4 models represents a significant leap forward companys self-driving capabilities ai4 hardware has not only a faster computer but also higher resolution cameras said nelson up until now theyve only been emulating hardware 3 cameras but now theyre taking training wheels off running ai4 full native resolution this upgrade enables tesla to fully leverage compute power higher-resolution imagery that ai4 offers over previous hardware versionsnelson also addressed a common concern among tesla owners about hardware 3s ability to keep up with future software updates management has mentioned that while they are developing at cutting edge with ai4 they will eventually backport these improvements to hardware 3 nelson explained there are millions of hardware 3 vehicles on road which makes it worthwhile to compress models adapt them for older platform he added that if necessary tesla could retrofit older vehicles with upgraded computers -- a complex but feasible solutionimprovements version 13 next leapversion 13 of fsd poised to make substantial improvements across board theyve already said that version 13 has a four-times increase miles between necessary interventions compared to version 1254 lutz pointed out this version expected to be delivered to internal customers imminently with a wider rollout targeted around thanksgiving much like version 12 which took a while to reach a full rollout version 13 a huge leap will be phased over time said nelsonthe panelists detailed several of new features included version 13 such as improved collision avoidance systems enhanced traffic control responses even ability to detect emergency vehicles through audio inputs one user actually showed that car could see an emergency vehicle coming moved to shoulder -- an impressive feature that speaks to depth of fsd system nelson saidthese advancements also include significant improvements ai architecture theyre scaling everything -- three times model size 42 times model context length five times training compute lutz explained its clear theyre throwing everything at improving fsd using much-expanded version of cortex this means bigger better more advanced models that will continue to improve performance of fsdchallenges of scheduling developmentdespite rapid pace of improvement there are inherent challenges to developing a technology as complex as teslas fsd this isnt like upgrading ios from version 16 to 17 lutz said were talking about entirely new capabilities that have never been done before so ability to schedule down to day becomes extremely difficult he emphasized that tesla making progress at an impressive pace especially when compared to previous versions of fsd theyre now converging on more predictable timelines delay has narrowed to about a 30-day window which pretty impressive given complexity lutz addeda global push expanding fsd beyond usanother topic of interest during panel was teslas expansion of fsd capabilities to international markets smart summon has now been released globally including europe china even though fsd supervision isnt yet fully approved these regions said ong this move he suggested signals teslas confidence that regulatory approvals are not far behind its easier to roll out these features other regions once you already have them functioning elsewhere nelson addedthe exponential path aheadthe panelists were unanimous their belief that teslas full self-driving system improving at an exponential rate theyre working through a punch list of engineering problems theyre getting it done said nelson continued upgrades hardware ai models sheer amount of data theyre processing means that fsd on an upward trajectory thats going to be very difficult for competitors to matchin near future teslas fsd system will be increasingly capable reliable ubiquitous as ong concluded even if there are delays teslas track record shows they will deliver these are engineering problems with solutions tesla one of few companies that have both technology ambition to solve themwith combined power of advanced ai robust data collection continued investment hardware teslas full self-driving poised to redefine whats possible autonomous driving -- not just us but globally

evs said david whiston an analyst at financial services firm morningstar inc getting rid of that tax credit wouldnt necessarily hurt themteslas lower-cost models source batteries from china which

257,2024-11-01,one year on we know this swedens trade unions are more than a match for elon musk | german bender,this long-running strike could be resolved if tesla recognised a simple fact that ive uncovered my reportingthe us presidential election has not been only high-stakes date looming for elon musk it has been more than a year since swedish workers came out on strike against his electric car giant tesla swedish industrial union if metall has been demanding better wages benefits conditions for mechanics tesla repair shops across country but fundamentally what at stake swedish labour market model of collective bargaining which musk refuses to recogniseit first only strike against tesla anywhere world it has now become longest-running strike sweden for a century april six months into dispute musk said actually i think storm has passed on that front i think things are reasonably good shape sweden that was not true then it not true nowthe past year has been marked by a wave of solidarity strikes by other unions to block shipping of tesla cars to swedish ports halt cleaning of tesla facilities withhold postal deliveries including new number plates to all tesla offices prevent tesla charging stations being connected to power grid tesla has repeatedly lost legal battles against these solidarity strikes was recently forced to pay sek65m (468000) legal costs to swedish postal service postnordtwelve swedish trade unions are involved three nordic ones including norways transport union fellesforbundet 3f transport denmark meanwhile tesla has brought strikebreakers from uk france italy spain finland denmark many other european countries to cover 52 striking workers almost half of teslas mechanics countrywhile legal under swedish law use of strikebreakers anathema for unions employers alike nordic countries where unwritten rules norms are essential to their model of worker protection which rests on collective agreements between employer employees negotiated via a union sweden almost 90% of workforce covered by a collective agreement across all sectors for tesla this seems to be of little concern to its notoriously anti-union ceoyet battle has implications far beyond this northernmost corner of europe united auto workers seeking to organise at tesla factories us powerful german union ig metall attempting to do same gr¬nheide site of teslas only european factory as johan jrvklo international secretary of if metall has said its really a global struggle sweden currently at forefrontfrom union perspective allowing tesla to get away without signing an agreement would risk encouraging other employers sweden europe to do same from teslas point of view there concern that saying yes to collective bargaining sweden could be used as leverage by unions other countries where tesla has factories many more employees sweden tesla only has dealerships offices repair shops charging stationsalthough teslas apprehension may be understandable it stems from a limited understanding of european industrial relations systems joining a union a fundamental right of all swedish workers almost half of companys mechanics sweden are union members this means that by law tesla has to negotiate with union on many issues even if no collective agreement has been signed if metall recently filed a lawsuit against tesla for failing to inform negotiate with union members over workplace changes accordance with swedish labour lawin addition some parts of europe collective bargaining agreements with one company an industry or region extend by law to most other companies that industry or region this case austria spain netherlands finland france where firms must comply with extended collective bargaining agreements whether they have signed them or notand it turns out tesla already has collective agreements europe although representatives of company reportedly stated last year that tesla has no collective agreement anywhere world my research has uncovered three local agreements between tesla france largest union france cfdt (they are registered on lgifrance official website of french government for publication of legal documents such as collective agreements) i believe this new discovery could help to resolve swedish stalemate prevent disputes other countrieswhy well since tesla already has to comply with sectoral collective agreements many countries even has local agreements france it would not be setting a precedent if it did same sweden so it should start to see unions as a partner to negotiate with rather than an enemyeven teslas own global human rights policy states that conformance with local law tesla respects right of workers to form join trade unions of their own choosing  or to form join other employee representative bodies  to bargain collectively if company operated spirit of this policy surely it should be perfectly able to adapt to different countries regulations norms prevent this unnecessary strike sweden from continuing any further into its second yearas esther lynch general secretary of european tuc said musk can make up his own rules when he reaches mars but if you want to do business europe then you need to play by europes rules that means respecting our tradition of collective bargaining,0.102359,positive
258,2024-10-27,tesla makes money selling electric vehicles but 86% of its earnings could soon come from this instead,cathie wood head of ark investment management which operates several exchange-traded funds (etfs) focused on innovative technology companies tesla (nasdaq tsla) stock one of top positions across arks portfolios wood calls it biggest artificial intelligence (ai) opportunity world thanks to companys full self-driving (fsd) softwaretesla currently generates around 79% of its revenue by selling passenger electric vehicles (evs) but ark released a set of financial models earlier this year that suggest that number about to shrink significantlyin fact by 2029 ark predicts a whopping 86% of teslas earnings will come from something else entirelyimage source teslateslas passenger ev business struggling at momentwhen tesla stock came public 2010 few analysts believed company would succeed mass-producing evs it certainly proved them wrong it delivered a record 18 million units 2023 alone however sales are clearly slowingtesla delivered 129 million evs first three quarters of 2024 which represented a drop of 23% compared to same period last year that means its annual deliveries are on track to shrink for first time since it launched flagship model s 2011 -- even though company has drastically slashed prices over past year to boost demanddemand softening across ev industry right now as consumers opt for cheaper gas-powered cars amid tough economic conditions headlined by high interest rates plus a report by goldman sachs suggests consumers are concerned about a lack of rapid charging infrastructure as well as declining resale value of evs generalbut tesla also faces a growing competitive threat with low-cost manufacturers like china-based byd threatening to flood global markets with cheap evs byds seagull sells for under $10000 china it could be on its way to europe 2025 those are important geographic markets for tesla none of its passenger evs can compete at that price pointtesla ceo elon musk outlined plans to build a low-cost ev which was expected to go into production 2025 sell for $25000 but during his conference call with investors for third quarter of 2024 (ended sept 30) he said project no longer going aheadfsd robotaxis are way forward according to muskmusk says building a low-cost passenger ev pointless because teslas future autonomous vehicles instead company unveiled cybercab earlier this month which a self-driving robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedalsthe cybercab will run on teslas fsd software which company has been developing for years however it does not have approval for unsupervised use us yet a human driver must be ready to take over at all times but based on data collected from extensive beta testing its passenger evs it possible that cybercab already safer than average car on roadaccording to teslas most recent quarterly vehicle safety report fsd caused one crash every 7 million miles compared to one crash every 700000 miles for average us driver other words fsd 10 times safer than human-driven vehicles statistically speaking as it stands todaythe software will only get better over time because ai models upon which it based are constantly learning from new data tesla currently building a cluster of 50000 graphics processing chips (gpus) from nvidia to train fsd further fact company on track to spend $11 billion on ai data center infrastructure this year for that very purposeas a result musk expects software to eventually receive regulatory approval for unsupervised use he says it could be available texas next year potentially californiafsd could transform teslas economicstesla expects to monetize fsd three primary waysowners of teslas passenger evs will also be able to lend their fsd-enabled cars to network to earn extra income which will be split with company plus cybercab will be available for purchase for an expected price of $30000 so practically anybody can buy a fleet set up their own driverless ride-hailing networkall of those revenue sources could carry high profit margins software companies for example often have a gross profit margin of 80% or more which far higher than teslas current gross margin of 198% across its portfolio of hardware businesses todayplus uber paid its drivers a whopping $179 billion last quarter alone which was its largest expense by far thats an indication of how much money tesla could save with an autonomous ride-hailing network operating at scalearks financial models suggest tesla will generate $12 trillion annual revenue by 2029 with fsd cybercab accounting for 63% however thanks to those high profit margins ark believes those products will account for 86% of a forecast $440 billion earnings before interest tax depreciation amortization (ebitda)arks forecast might be ambitious tesla stock isnt cheap right nowwall streets consensus estimate (according to yahoo) suggests tesla on track to generate $99 billion total revenue 2024 that means it will have to grow twelvefold by 2029 -- or by a compound annual rate of 647% for next five years -- to meet arks forecastfsd cybercab will have to scale up rapidly for tesla to grow at that pace because $99 billion revenue this year would represent growth of just 2% compared to 2023 2025 wall street expects revenue to grow by just 15% simply put passenger ev sales alone wont get job doneplus investors have to pay a hefty price to bet on teslas autonomous future because its stock currently trades at a steep premium to broader market based on its trailing-12-month earnings per share of $365 its stock currently sits at a price to earnings (p/e) ratio of 685 thats more than double 321 p/e of nasdaq-100 technology indexteslas future incredibly exciting but according to musks own forecast cybercab wont go into mass production until 2026 that means companys fate will rest on passenger ev sales for at least next year while musk thinks they could grow by as much as 30% 2025 i have doubts considering low-cost model no longer going ahead which leaves brand susceptible to competitors like bydin summary ark might be right about fsd cybercab eventually but its 2029 target ambitious therefore it might be best to wait until we receive more information next year before buying tesla stock

millions of vehiclesshortcomings of camera-only autonomous techthe crashes highlight a key weakness teslas approach to autonomous driving -- its reliance on a camera-only system unlike some competitors which use lidar or radar alongside cameras tesla has doubled down on visual-based technology this decision has drawn criticism from industry experts especially cases where weather or environmental conditions impair visibilityjeff schuster vice president at globaldata pointed out that relying solely on cameras might be problematic weather conditions can impact cameras ability to see things i think regulatory environment will certainly weigh on this schuster saidteslas previous recalls investigationsthis isnt teslas first brush with safety concerns last december tesla issued a massive recall affecting over two million vehicles to address issues with its autopilot system company deployed a software update aimed at improving safety features but recall didnt stop growing wave of concern over its autonomous technologywe at tesla believe that we have a moral obligation to continue improving our already best-in-class safety systems company said at time at same time we also believe it morally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers given incontrovertible data that shows it saving lives preventing injurythe nhtsa also still probing whether recall was sufficient or if drivers continue to face risks when using teslas fsd justice department has been investigating teslas fsd autopilot systems since 2022what exactly nhtsa investigatingthe nhtsas preliminary investigation will focus on evaluating whether teslas fsd system can accurately detect respond to situations with limited visibility such as sun glare fog or

street analysts,the technological advances that have taken place over past couple of decades have had a dramatic impact on world we live there has also been a noticeable shift stock market -- evidence undeniablejust 20 years ago household names like general electric (nyse ge) exxonmobile (nyse xom) were most valuable companies world measured by market cap worth $319 billion $283 billion respectively now technology issues lead listto be clear $1 trillion club still fairly elite with just eight us companies making cut (as of this writing) they include nvidia apple microsoft amazon alphabet meta platforms taiwan semiconductor manufacturing but this exclusive fraternity just added its newest memberin wake of us presidential election tesla (nasdaq tsla) stock surged to levels not seen more than two years bringing its market cap above $1 trillion threshold its worth noting that tesla first hit a trillion-dollar valuation late 2021 but ceded its membership during downturn only to come roaring back retake its place among worlds most valuable companieshowever some on wall street believe electric vehicle (ev) maker just getting started lets look at recent challenges what could drive tesla stock even higher coming years why wall street still bullishto be clear some investors have been decidedly bearish on tesla over past couple of years a sentiment thats understandable biggest headwind was economic downturn decades-high inflation that came with it federal reserve bank took appropriate steps to rein surging inflation namely by raising interest rates this results higher borrowing costs which over time tends to slow overheated prices lower inflationthis was a double whammy for tesla during a difficult economy consumers tend to put off big purchases such as buying a car furthermore even least expensive tesla ev on average more expensive than its gas-powered counterparts so while some consumers put off buying a car altogether others were trading down to lower-priced optionsthen theres matter of financing interest rates ultimately increased to a 23-year high which discouraged borrowers from taking out car loans putting tesla models out of reach for large swaths of population however after a couple years of uncertainty it appears carmaker has finally turned cornerin third quarter teslas total revenue of $25 billion climbed 8% year over year while operating income jumped 54% companys focus on cutting production costs bearing fruit dropping more profits to bottom line add to that improving economy feds decision to begin cutting interest rates you have all elements place for long-awaited tesla reboundwall street bullishtesla has been on a noteworthy rally over past several weeks with stock price up 32% over past month (as of this writing) despite its epic run some on wall street are still remarkably bullishchief among them bank of america analyst john murphy who maintains a buy rating on stock just increased his price target to a street-high $350 per share that represents potential upside of 18% for investors compared to wednesdays closing pricethe analyst believes company will benefit from policy changes under trump administration those could include revising regulations for teslas full self-driving (fsd) feature imposing tariffs on imports president-elect trump promised on campaign trailwedbush analyst dan ives has an outperform (buy) rating a $300 price target on tesla echoed some of same points biggest winner from a trump white house remains tesla ives wrote analyst suggested that trump could accelerate some of fsd autonomous initiatives for tesla starting 2025ives has previously noted that while there could be an end to ev rebates tax incentives that could ultimately be a positive development for tesla analyst noted tesla has scale scope that unmatched ev industry this dynamic gives  tesla a clear competitive advantage a non-ev subsidy environment ives also suggested that tariffs on chinese imports could make these cheaper evs less competitiveits also worth noting vast potential that exists from upcoming launch of teslas cybercab robotaxi while vehicle still development it could upend industry as we know it at a recent product event to introduce prototype ceo elon musk noted that streamlined design production improvements paved way for cost-effective manufacturing of cybercab at scale company believes robotaxi could be production before 2027if musks plans come to fruition -- thats a big if -- they could be a game-changer for tesla cathie wood of ark invest has a price target of $2600 on tesla stock though it hinges on release ultimate success of cybercab that represents potential upside for investors of 775% though some view that potential future as a longshotid be remiss if i didnt address that matter of stocks valuation teslas post-election spike has it trading at roughly 119 times forward earnings 8 times forward sales so investor concerns about its price tag are understandablefor those who already own tesla stock bravo hang on to those shares for those who dont tesla has proven time again how volatile it allowing astute investors to own stock at a much more reasonable valuation as recently as april investors could have picked up shares for half their current priceto justify its current valuation shareholders have to believe that tesla will continue to sell more evs continue to cut production costs capitalize on its foray into artificial intelligence eventually deliver on its robotaxi promises thats clearly a tall order but if it comes to pass

fsd which relies solely on optical cameras following cruises recent issues waymo positioned as clear leader able to scale more effectively navigate regulatory challenges its cautionary approach to expanding its services backed by alphabets resources allows it to refine perfect its systems for broader rollout strengthening its foothold av space gms cruise learning from setbacks moving forward general motors  cruise was previously neck-and-neck with waymo particularly before challenges it faced late 2023 cruise operates its av service using a modified chevy bolt electric vehicle fleet company also developed an origin vehicle prototype designed for autonomous operation without a drivers seat or steering wheel however regulatory safety challenges have delayed this project as current fmvss standards do not yet allow completely driverless vehicles on public roads after a major incident 2023 gm ceo mary barra cruises leadership took a conservative approach re-evaluating project shelving origin until regulatory environment catches up cruises setbacks however have been more of a pause than a defeat companys cautious stance now demonstrates gms commitment to safety compliance which could give it an advantage as a trusted provider of autonomous solutions cruise also operates with a similar sensor-rich setup to waymo integrating lidar radar cameras collectively providing a more reliable system than teslas camera-only approach by adopting this layered hardware model cruise aims to produce a safer more accurate av experience which particularly valuable densely populated urban areas where it primarily operates teslas approach speed practicality over redundancy teslas fsd software relies primarily on optical cameras supported by advanced ai algorithms to interpret road environment teslas founder elon musk argues that if humans can drive with only vision cars should also be able to this approach appealing due to its simplicity cost-effectiveness but has notable limitations unlike multi-sensor setups of waymo cruise teslas reliance on cameras alone presents challenges particularly low-visibility conditions like fog snow or harsh sunlight critics have also pointed out cases of teslas fsd software malfunctioning with reports of vehicles mistakenly accelerating or failing to detect obstacles additionally teslas fsd software could face scrutiny from national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) coming years suppose regulators decide that teslas camera-only system falls short of safety standards that case it may lead to recalls or stricter oversight ultimately affecting teslas bottom line delaying further fsd advancements tesla has taken a bold stance on their technological approach evidence suggests that it safer than unassisted human drivers still a potential future more rigorous regulatory framework poses a possible risk factor for investors hardware ai stack a key differentiator advanced sensor suites waymo cruise use come at a high cost lidar radar optical cameras accompanying ai telematics systems represent an extensive investment hardware technology these vehicles essentially act as mobile test labs providing invaluable data experience current cost of these high-tech systems prohibitive for mass-market consumer vehicles still similar trends were seen early computing where enormous machines eventually led to more affordable consumer computers as technology advances costs decrease hardware todays avs could eventually become viable consumer vehicles teslas choice to rely on cameras alone driven by cost reduction aiming to create a more affordable option for consumers however this strategy may limit teslas scalability commercial autonomous services where reliability safety are paramount regulatory infrastructure hurdles waymo cruise also benefit from more conservative regulatory strategies which may be more sustainable long term gm particular willing to wait until regulators have established clear guidelines contrast tesla has often pushed boundaries of regulation which could pose risks for future development if regulators clamp down moreover waymo cruise are better prepared for future changes telematics infrastructure upcoming 5g network slicing which expected to improve data upload speeds will be vital for avs that need constant connectivity currently teslas approach does not capitalize on telematics advancements same way as waymo cruise further narrowing its competitive edge avs value autonomous driving adds to stock currently alphabet gm tesla are not generating meaningful revenue from autonomous driving or robotics technology some buyers may purchase teslas over alternatives due to their current autopilot fsd offerings promise of future enhancements similarly gms supercruise-assisted driving widely recognized as one of best significantly outperforming offerings from rivals such as ford stellantis i am a big fan of tesla products elon musk he has proven that he can take ideas to reality even competing against far larger companies with more financial resources an enormous head start car business i would therefore challenge anyone to identify a better technology entrepreneur to lead a business this area from same starting point today problem for an investor that these companies are orders of magnitude apart from a valuation perspective observing commonly used multiples of these companies they are so different that tsla needs a dedicated axis (plotted on right) as its valuation much greater than either alphabet or gm which are plotted on primary/left y axis below fairness tsla has grown materially recent years only us automaker that manufactures sells evs profitably still safety of an investment a function of price investors pay for it lets look at another example price to sales or enterprise value to forward ebit no matter how you look at it teslas current valuation pricing a lot of future growth final thoughts for investors looking at autonomous vehicles googles waymo gms cruise provide robust safety-oriented platforms with promising growth potential at same time tesla has captured publics imagination with its fsd technology none of these companies are yet generating profits or free cash flow from their robotics autonomous driving technologies but investors have already priced presumed success at tesla alphabets valuation currently looks reasonable whether or not their waymo investment pays off hugely waymo should it succeed just icing on cake gm needs success from cruise program; its current valuation trading at a mid-single-digit pe ratio suggest it may be existential ceo mary barras commitment to it indicates she believes that too that low multiple does provide a margin of safety on long side gm does not need to knock cover off ball to prove a good investment if they can consistently grow at pace of global economy cyclically adjusted they deserve a much higher multiple tesla elon musk meanwhile will likely continue to astonish us by using practical solutions while innovating still it will be harder for stock to rocket higher given that so much of that already priced trade much like a pairs trade one way to affect this thesis to create offsetting positions with similar structures such as long call spreads on desired longs short call spreads on desired short position objective assuming one chooses to use options rather than simply buying googl gm taking unlimited risk of going short tsla to limit total risk taken have long short positions offsetting one another to mitigate market volatility minimize theta or options decay net of all positions sell dec 13 tsla $260 call buy dec 13 tsla $275 call buy dec 13 googl $165 call sell dec 13 googl $180 call buy dec 13 gm $48 call sell dec 13 gm $56 call thesis not that tesla will not deliver on their technological promises someday or a bet against elon musk -- which a bit like betting against secretariat

intressantes surtout avec le robotaxi et lautonomie je pense que nous finirons par fournir aux consommateurs le transport avec le plus bas co¯t par kilomtre que ce quils ont connu jusquÿ maintenant en regardant certaines de nos projections il semblerait quun trajet en robotaxi co¯terait moins cher quun ticket de bus un ticket de bus subventionn ou un ticket de mtro subventionn je pense que ce produit peut ¦tre trs puissant et que nous aspirons ÿ atteindre la production en volume en 2024 je pense quil sera vraiment un moteur important de la croissance de tesla  a dclar musk lors de la confrence tlphonique avec les actionnaires de teslaplus tt ce mois-ci lors de linauguration de la gigafactory de tesla ÿ austin au texas musk a prsent une varit de produits futurs qui sloignent de son activit de voitures personnelles qui gnre la majeure partie de ses bnfices aujourdhui parmi ces nouveaux produits il tait question dun robotaxi et doptimus le concept de robot humanode de tesla en outre la qu¦te du robotaxi de tesla le met en concurrence avec des entreprises qui dveloppent depuis des annes des technologies de vhicules autonomes pour les robotaxis notamment waymo dalphabet et cruise la filiale de gm spcialise dans la conduite autonomecela remet galement en question lintention de tesla de mettre au rebut sa stratgie actuelle vers lautonomie complte ou si celle-ci sera dveloppe en parallle en effet musk fait allusion au robotaxi depuis des annes mais pas par le biais dun produit autonome comme celui quil a dcrit mercredi au lieu de cela il a promis ÿ plusieurs reprises de transformer les vhicules tesla que les gens possdent djÿ en leur propre robotaxi grce ÿ son systme avanc daide ÿ la conduite (adas) amlior appel logiciel full self-driving (fsd) qui co¯te actuellement 12 000 dollars il sagit dune version amliore de lautopilot des voitures teslales propritaires peuvent acheter le systme fsd dont musk a promis ÿ plusieurs reprises quil offrirait un jour une conduite autonome complte le fsd nest pas capable de conduire de manire autonome il est considr comme un adas de niveau 2 et ncessite toujours lattention et le contrle dun conducteur humain des dizaines de vidos postes par des propritaires donnent une image mitige des capacits du logiciel et comprennent de nombreux clips montrant des vhicules qui ne parviennent pas ÿ sorienter dans une conduite de base et qui dvient m¦me soudainement vers des pitons ou dans une autre voieau cours de la confrence tlphonique musk a reconnu que ses vhicules sont largement inaccessibles pour de nombreuses personnes en raison de leur co¯t lev et considre lintroduction des robotaxis comme une faon de fournir aux clients un moyen de transport trs moins cher cela dit musk na pas rvl la suite de capteurs que tesla envisage pour ce vhicule spcialement conu il na pas non plus confirm que tesla nutilisera que des camras ou galement un lidar et un radar ce qui est la norme dans le secteur le fsd et lautopilot de tesla se sont toujours appuys sur les camras et une approche base sur la vision pour atteindre lautonomiependant ce temps la plupart des autres socits de vhicules autonomes utilisent une combinaison de camras de radars et de lidars mais au cours de la confrence tlphonique musk a admis quil tait difficile de parvenir ÿ une conduite autonome complte avec cette mthode qui finit par ¦tre un jeu constant de deux pas en avant un pas en arrire  de tous les dveloppements technologiques auxquels jai particip je nai jamais vu autant de fausses aubes ou dendroits o il semble que nous allons percer mais nous ne le faisons pas que dans le cas de la conduite autonome complte  a dclar musk en fin de compte pour vendre la conduite autonome complte il faut rsoudre le problme de lintelligence artificielle dans le monde rel que personne na rsolu lensemble du systme routier est conu pour des rseaux neuronaux et des yeux biologiques donc en fait quand on y pense pour rsoudre le problme de la conduite nous devons rsoudre le problme des rseaux neuronaux et des camras ÿ un degr de capacit gal voire suprieur ÿ celui des humains et je pense que nous y parviendrons cette anne

resale values compared to other evs due to a combination of some of factors weve mentioned above being evs they still lose a lot of their value over years but weve seen examples of model 3 model y retain impressive yields past few years when compared to key rivals teslas status as a leader ev market contributes to sustained high demand for its vehicles both new used buyers trust tesla for its proven performance innovative features extensive supercharging network which makes used models particularly appealinganother reason why teslas tend to perform a lot better once they hit used market because they typically benefit from a more trustworthy reliable reputation using model 3 as an example once again we see that 2024 model year benefits from a 47/100 predicted reliability rating from consumer reports this a low score but it relatively better than most of its competition due to nature of evs still being somewhat untrustworthy to many consumers jd power gives same model a 74/100

plug on one end cars charging port on other (and because ccs plug different shapes depending on kind of charging you need a separate adapter to use a slower charger with a tesla-style plug)and problem not just as simple as getting pieces to fit together sun says not only does this hardware need to be changed but also now software needs to be able to distinguish which mode it at she says referring to vehicle software that manages battery charginglast but not least tesla needs to give drivers access to charging systemuntil recently without access to superchargers drivers have relied on open networks like electrify america evgo among others surveys from jd power automotive market research firm have consistently found that drivers are less satisfied with non-tesla networks which have far fewer chargers have struggled with reliabilitya spokesperson from electrify america wrote a statement to npr that charging industry still its early stages that company has remained focused on driving customer satisfaction including by replacing more than 800 chargers 2024 a representative from evgo wrote that it has several initiatives to enhance overall customer experience including building larger stations higher-powered chargers since start of 2022 evgo has upgraded replaced or decommissioned legacy equipment at more than 500 stalls across over 20 states to better serve our customers statement saidjd powers data shows satisfaction with non-tesla chargers improving -- although so far not enough to catch up with teslafor a long time this problem didnt affect many people because tesla sold vast majority of evs us but as other automakers scaled up production a growing number of people have been buying those brands there are now some 15 million non-tesla evs on road according to experian -- many of those drivers have been eying teslas walled garden with envyin 2023 a door appeared walled garden white house negotiated with tesla to open a small number of supercharger stations to general public tesla came up with an adapter integrated into those superchargers so drivers could charge vehicles with ccs ports without needing to bring their own adapter exchange tesla became eligible for some of billions federal funds pouring into expanding nations fast-charger networka few months later garden walls started to fall fords ceo appeared on what was then twitter (now x) with elon musk -- owner of both x tesla -- to make surprise announcement that ford was adopting teslas charging technology  exchange getting drivers access to superchargers im really excited about what this means for customers ford ceo jim farley said our goal really to be as helpful as possible accelerating towards sustainable transport musk said latergm followed soon after with a similar announcement then so did all other automakersat last plug war was overwhy would companies abandon a standard they had all been using for years give a major coup to their rivalthe answer mostly that car buyers are anxious about road trips majority of time people who own an ev plug it at home or work charge at slower speeds its cheaper easier on car more convenient than stopping to charge of course most drivers spend a lot more time commuting than they do driving long distancesbut on road trips you need to charge much faster thats where teslas supercharger network designed to address this precise anxiety promises to helprivian an all-electric automaker based normal illinois one of first companies to get access to teslas chargers building out an ecosystem of charging locations to allow drivers to get to where they need to go a cornerstone of increasing ev adoption rivian vice president paul frey told npr a statement he called accessing tesla supercharger network an important step this journeyso i put networks promise to test by driving through pennsylvania ohio on a round trip of nearly 900 miles a borrowed rivian r1s suv while r1s still being built with a ccs charging port company supplied me with an adapter i programmed infotainment system to route me to whatever chargers made sense tesla includedmy first pennsylvania charging stop -- not at a tesla station -- had four chargers as i pulled up a repairman was already there (in an electric pickup truck naturally) at work troubleshooting he didnt want to give his name because he wasnt authorized to talk to press but did tell me that chargers were a little finicky three out of four werent working properlylater on trip i stopped at a different competitors charging station also with four chargers three of them were occupied last one out of orderevery supercharger i visited contrast had at least 12 chargers at least 8 of them open every one i tried worked they were fast there were so many of them having superchargers available tripled number of 150 kw chargers available to me on one 7-hour stretch of my drive this case grass really was greener on other side of that garden wallive charged teslas at superchargers before plugging rivian wasnt quite as seamless of course theres an adapter to wrangle i also encountered some trouble starting charge just by plugging had to ultimately use tesla app rivian says that was an isolated glitch possibly tied to me using a loaner vehicleparking non-tesla vehicles can also be tricky or at least an etiquette minefield charger ports are a different spot on different vehicles tesla chargers were designed well for teslas that means you often have to take up two spaces to charge one carand not every ev can use superchargers yet so far only ford rivian gm vehicles have widespread access to network even for those brands some of very oldest superchargers remain tesla-onlymy experience wasnt unique according to jd power non-tesla drivers who access superchargers are not quite as happy with them as tesla drivers are with biggest frustrations being ease of payment of charging but they are still significantly happier with superchargers than they are with fast chargers overalltheres an advantage to a walled garden -- its easier to troubleshoot a system which just one company controls both sides whether its iphones talking to macbooks or a tesla vehicle connecting to a tesla charger more companies with different hardware software that have to communicate means more friction tesla typically does not respond to requests for comment did not reply to inquiries for this story but paul suhey cofounder of revel -- a charging network whose locations are all equipped with both kinds of ports -- said that its undeniable that opening up a charger network to more brands adds complexityi think 100% you have advantages when you have compatibility between charger vehicle itself said suhey but he said companies have made a lot of progress addressing this through standardization its their best interests to work togetherits not just lip service suhey said when you think about companies incentives biggest thing that we want more evs biggest thing that ev manufacturers want more charging so all of that just gets easier more that we standardizefor tesla opening up system means a new revenue source but will it benefit tesla driversin long run this pivot will mean more chargers that they can easily use as their port becomes standard everywhere near term though it means a little more competition for chargers jd power found that since start of 2024 tesla owners have become less satisfied with availability of chargers albeit still very happy with their charging experiencebill lowe a model 3 owner was finishing his fast charge at a supercharger ohio when i pulled up i asked him what he thought about system opening upi think its good he said supercharger network my opinion teslas secret sauce as long as access to chargers fair stations dont get all clogged up with long lines of cars he said he thinks its a positive changethat said for lowe long lines are only a hypothetical problem he lives tennessee a part of country where ev adoption low ive never had a problem with pulling up to a supercharger thats been full yet he saiddrivers california might have a very different experience as of mid-2024 34% of all nations registered evs were california 25% of nations charging infrastructure as a result state has one of worst ratios of evs to chargers countrytesla addressing some of these challenges as it tries to welcome new customers to network without alienating current drivers company adding longer charging cables at new or upgraded supercharger sites to accommodate other models while it has slowed plans to add more supercharger stations it has also promised to focus more on expanding existing onesswitching over to new standard -- which now called nacs north american charging standard since it no longer tesla-exclusive -- will take time a lot of timeadapters are only a temporary solution until automakers start rolling out new evs that are designed to charge at teslas network we work virtually with every [automaker] world says sun of te connectivity whoever wants to sell their vehicle north america they are on this journey to converting to nacsover next year or two companies will start delivering cars with nacs ports built inmeanwhile rival charging companies -- like electrify america others -- are adding nacs plugs to their ports some companies have them already others are promising them within next couple of yearsrick wilmer ceo of charging company chargepoint says having to bring your own adapter a hassle for drivers thats one reason chargepoint has designed chargers with a built-in adapter that can work for both ccs nacs vehiclesbut he said its worth it for industry to switch to a single standard however many years it takes from now when all cars on road are all same all chargers are same thats going to be a better place he saidwilmer for example drives a ford f-150 lightning with a ccs port im not getting rid of it any time soon he pointed out vehicles like his will stay on streets for eight ten 12 15 years wilmer guesseswere going to be living a world of two connectors for a good long time he saidafter all rival technologies dont fade away immediately

dem s¬dlichen ende von tesla das bohrloch durchteufte erfolgreich die zone tesla unmittelbarer nhe der zone bridge dieses bohrloch durchteufte nicht nur die mineralisierten haupthorizonte von tesla und besttigte damit deren kontinuitt sondern durchteufte auch eine zustzliche mineralisierungszone im vergleich zu ts-24-29 die offenbar einen verkr¬mmten versatz und eine wiederholung der tesla-mineralisierung einem interpretierten unteren verwerfungsabschnitt darstellt der wahrscheinlich mit der faltung und verwerfung zusammenhngt die die tesla-zone ihre derzeitige position im

bestehenden bohrlchern einem gebiet mit begrenzten bohrungen nahe dem s¬dlichen ende von tesla das bohrloch durchteufte erfolgreich die zone tesla unmittelbarer nhe der zone bridge dieses bohrloch durchteufte nicht nur die mineralisierten haupthorizonte von tesla und besttigte damit deren kontinuitt sondern durchteufte auch eine zustzliche mineralisierungszone im vergleich zu ts-24-29 die offenbar einen verkr¬mmten versatz und eine wiederholung der tesla-mineralisierung einem interpretierten unteren verwerfungsabschnitt darstellt der wahrscheinlich mit der faltung und verwerfung zusammenhngt die die tesla-zone ihre derzeitige position im verhltnis zur mcilvenna bay gebracht hat diese zustzliche mineralisierungszone wurde auch dem zuvor verffentlichten bohrloch ts-23-11w2 (siehe pressemitteilung von foran vom 25 mai 2023) durchteuft das eine hnliche zusammenhngende mineralisierungszone durchteufte die aus massivsulfid und einer stringerartigen mineralisierung etwa 350

of black plastic about 5 inches long which clicks into tesla charging plug on one end cars charging port on other (and because ccs plug different shapes depending on kind of charging you need a separate adapter to use a slower charger with a tesla-style plug)and problem not just as simple as getting pieces to fit together sun says not only does this hardware need to be changed but also now software needs to be able to distinguish which mode it at she says referring to vehicle software that manages battery charginglast but not least tesla needs to give drivers access to charging systemuntil recently without access to superchargers drivers have relied on open networks like electrify america evgo among others surveys from jd power automotive market research firm have

that charging industry still its early stages that company has remained focused on driving customer satisfaction including by replacing more than 800 chargers 2024 a representative from evgo wrote that it has several initiatives to enhance overall customer experience including building larger stations higher-powered chargers since start of 2022 evgo has upgraded replaced or decommissioned legacy equipment at more than 500 stalls across over 20 states to better serve our customers statement saidjd powers data shows satisfaction with non-tesla chargers improving -- although so far not enough to catch up with teslafor a long time this problem didnt affect many people because tesla sold vast majority of evs us but as other automakers scaled up production a growing number of people have been buying those brands there are now some 15 million non-tesla evs on road according to experian -- many of those drivers have been eying teslas walled garden with envyin 2023 a door appeared walled garden white house negotiated with tesla to open a small number of supercharger stations to general public tesla came up with an adapter integrated into those superchargers so drivers could charge vehicles with ccs ports without needing to bring their own adapter exchange tesla became eligible for some of billions federal funds pouring into expanding nations fast-charger networka few months later garden walls started to fall fords ceo appeared on what was then twitter (now x) with elon musk -- owner of both x tesla -- to make surprise announcement that ford was adopting teslas charging technology  exchange getting drivers access to superchargers im really excited about what this means for customers ford ceo jim farley said our goal really to be as helpful as possible accelerating towards sustainable transport musk said latergm followed soon after with a similar announcement then so did all other automakerswhy would companies abandon a standard they had all been using for years give a major coup to their rivalthe answer mostly that car buyers are anxious about road trips majority of time people who own an ev plug it at home or work charge at slower speeds its cheaper easier on car more convenient than stopping to charge of course most drivers spend a lot more time commuting than they do driving long distancesbut on road trips you need to charge much faster thats where teslas supercharger network designed to address this precise anxiety promises to helprivian an all-electric automaker based normal illinois one of first companies to get access to teslas chargers building out an ecosystem of charging locations to allow drivers to get to where they need to go a cornerstone of increasing ev adoption rivian vice president paul frey told npr a statement he called accessing tesla supercharger network an important step this journeyso i put networks promise to test by driving through pennsylvania ohio on a round trip of nearly 900 miles a borrowed rivian r1s suv while r1s still being built with a ccs charging port company supplied me with an adapter i programmed infotainment system to route me to whatever chargers made sense tesla includedmy first pennsylvania charging stop -- not at a tesla station -- had four chargers as i pulled up a repairman was already there (in an electric pickup truck naturally) at work troubleshooting he didnt want to give his name because he wasnt authorized to talk to press but did tell me that chargers were a little finicky three out of four werent working properlylater on trip i stopped at a different competitors charging station also with four chargers three of them were occupied last one out of orderevery supercharger i visited contrast had at least 12 chargers at least 8 of them open every one i tried worked they were fast there were so many of them having superchargers available tripled number of 150 kw chargers available to me on one 7-hour stretch of my drive this case grass really was greener on other side of that garden wallsyncing up across companiesive charged teslas at superchargers before plugging rivian wasnt quite as seamless of course theres an adapter to wrangle i also encountered some trouble starting charge just by plugging had to ultimately use tesla app rivian says that was an isolated glitch possibly tied to me using a loaner vehicleparking non-tesla vehicles can also be tricky or at least an etiquette minefield charger ports are a different spot on different vehicles tesla chargers were designed well for teslas that means you often have to take up two spaces to charge one carand not every ev can use superchargers yet so far only ford rivian gm vehicles have widespread access to network even for those brands some of very oldest superchargers remain tesla-onlymy experience wasnt unique according to jd power non-tesla drivers who access superchargers are not quite as happy with them as tesla drivers are with biggest frustrations being ease of payment of charging but they are still significantly happier with superchargers than they are with fast chargers overalltheres an advantage to a walled garden -- its easier to troubleshoot a system which just one company controls both sides whether its iphones talking to macbooks or a tesla vehicle connecting to a tesla charger more companies with different hardware software that have to communicate means more friction tesla typically does not respond to requests for comment did not reply to inquiries for this story but paul suhey cofounder of revel -- a charging network whose locations are all equipped with both kinds of ports -- said that its undeniable that opening up a charger network to more brands adds complexityi think 100% you have advantages when you have compatibility between charger vehicle itself said suhey but he said companies have made a lot of progress addressing this through standardization its their best interests to work togetherits not just lip service suhey said when you think about companies incentives biggest thing that we want more evs biggest thing that ev manufacturers want more charging so all of that just gets easier more that we standardizefor tesla opening up system means a new revenue source but will it benefit tesla driversin long run this pivot will mean more chargers that they can easily use as their port becomes standard everywhere near term though it means a little more competition for chargers jd power found that since start of 2024 tesla owners have become less satisfied with availability of chargers albeit still very happy with their charging experiencebill lowe a model 3 owner was finishing his fast charge at a supercharger ohio when i pulled up i asked him what he thought about system opening upi think its good he said supercharger network my opinion teslas secret sauce as long as access to chargers fair stations dont get all clogged up with long lines of cars he said he thinks its a positive changethat said for lowe long lines are only a hypothetical problem he lives tennessee a part of country where ev adoption low ive never had a problem with pulling up to a supercharger thats been full yet he saiddrivers california might have a very different experience as of mid-2024 34% of all nations registered evs were california 25% of nations charging infrastructure as a result state has one of worst ratios of evs to chargers countrytesla addressing some of these challenges as it tries to welcome new customers to network without alienating current drivers company adding longer charging cables at new or upgraded supercharger sites to accommodate other models while it has slowed plans to add more supercharger stations it has also promised to focus more on expanding existing onesthe age of adapterswitching over to new standard -- which now called nacs north american charging standard since it no longer tesla-exclusive -- will take time a lot of timeadapters are only a temporary solution until automakers start rolling out new evs that are designed to charge at teslas network we work virtually with every [automaker] world says sun of te connectivity whoever wants to sell their vehicle north america they are on this journey to converting to nacsover next year or two companies will start delivering cars with nacs ports built inmeanwhile rival charging companies -- like electrify america others -- are adding nacs plugs to their ports some companies have them already others are promising them within next couple of yearsrick wilmer ceo of charging company chargepoint says having to bring your own adapter a hassle for drivers thats one reason chargepoint has designed chargers with a built-in adapter that can work for both ccs nacs vehiclesbut he said its worth it for industry to switch to a single standard however many years it takes from now when all cars on road are all same all chargers are same thats going to be a better place he saidwilmer for example drives a ford f-150 lightning with a ccs port im not getting rid of it any time soon he pointed out vehicles like his will stay on streets for eight ten 12 15 years wilmer guesseswere going to be living a world of two connectors for a good long time he saidafter all rival technologies dont fade away immediately fun trivia fact last betamax tape was produced 2016,0.144454,positive

walled garden white house negotiated with tesla to open a small number of supercharger stations to general public tesla came up with an adapter integrated into those superchargers so drivers could charge vehicles with ccs ports without needing to bring their own adapter exchange tesla became eligible for some of billions federal funds pouring into expanding nations fast-charger networka few months later garden walls started to fall fords ceo appeared on what was then twitter (now x) with elon musk -- owner of both x tesla -- to make surprise announcement that ford was adopting teslas charging technology  exchange getting drivers access to superchargers im really excited about what this means for customers ford ceo jim farley said our goal really to be as helpful as possible accelerating towards sustainable transport musk said latergm followed soon after with a similar announcement then so did all other automakersat last plug war was overwhy would companies abandon a standard they had all been using for years give a major coup to their rivalthe answer mostly that car buyers are anxious about road trips majority of time people who own an ev plug it at home or work charge at slower speeds its cheaper easier on car more convenient than stopping to charge of course most drivers spend a lot more time commuting than they do driving long distancesbut on road trips you need to charge much faster thats where teslas supercharger network designed to address this precise anxiety promises to helprivian an all-electric automaker based normal illinois one of first companies to get access to teslas chargers building out an ecosystem of charging locations to allow drivers to get to where they need to go a cornerstone of increasing ev adoption rivian vice president paul frey told npr a statement he called accessing tesla supercharger network an important step this journeyso i put networks promise to test by driving through pennsylvania ohio on a round trip of nearly 900 miles a borrowed rivian r1s suv while r1s still being built with a ccs charging port company supplied me with an adapter i programmed infotainment system to route me to whatever chargers made sense tesla includedmy first pennsylvania charging stop -- not at a tesla station -- had four chargers as i pulled up a repairman was already there (in an electric pickup truck naturally) at work troubleshooting he didnt want to give his name because he wasnt authorized to talk to press but did tell me that chargers were a little finicky three out of four werent working properlylater on trip i stopped at a different competitors charging station also with four chargers three of them were occupied last one out of orderevery supercharger i visited contrast had at least 12 chargers at least 8 of them open every one i tried worked they were fast there were so many of them having superchargers available tripled number of 150 kw chargers available to me on one 7-hour stretch of my drive this case grass really was greener on other side of that garden wallive charged teslas at superchargers before plugging rivian wasnt quite as seamless of course theres an adapter to wrangle i also encountered some trouble starting charge just by plugging had to ultimately use tesla app rivian says that was an isolated glitch possibly tied to me using a loaner vehicleparking non-tesla vehicles can also be tricky or at least an etiquette minefield charger ports are a different spot on different vehicles tesla chargers were designed well for teslas that means you often have to take up two spaces to charge one carand not every ev can use superchargers yet so far only ford rivian gm vehicles have widespread access to network even for those brands some of very oldest superchargers remain tesla-onlymy experience wasnt unique according to jd power non-tesla drivers who access superchargers are not quite as happy with them as tesla drivers are with biggest frustrations being ease of payment of charging but they are still significantly happier with superchargers than they are with fast chargers overalltheres an advantage to a walled garden -- its easier to troubleshoot a system which just one company controls both sides whether its iphones talking to macbooks or a tesla vehicle connecting to a tesla charger more companies with different hardware software that have to communicate means more friction tesla typically does not respond to requests for comment did not reply to inquiries for this story but paul suhey cofounder of revel -- a charging network whose locations are all equipped with both kinds of ports -- said that its undeniable that opening up a charger network to more brands adds complexityi think 100% you have advantages when you have compatibility between charger vehicle itself said suhey but he said companies have made a lot of progress addressing this through standardization its their best interests to work togetherits not just lip service suhey said when you think about companies incentives biggest thing that we want more evs biggest thing that ev manufacturers want more charging so all of that just gets easier more that we standardizefor tesla opening up system means a new revenue source but will it benefit tesla driversin long run this pivot will mean more chargers that they can easily use as their port becomes standard everywhere near term though it means a little more competition for chargers jd power found that since start of 2024 tesla owners have become less satisfied with availability of chargers albeit still very happy with their charging experiencebill lowe a model 3 owner was finishing his fast charge at a supercharger ohio when i pulled up i asked him what he thought about system opening upi think its good he said supercharger network my opinion teslas secret sauce as long as access to chargers fair stations dont get all clogged up with long lines of cars he said he thinks its a positive changethat said for lowe long lines are only a hypothetical problem he lives tennessee a part of country where ev adoption low ive never had a problem with pulling up to a supercharger thats been full yet he saiddrivers california might have a very different experience as of mid-2024 34% of all nations registered evs were california 25% of nations charging infrastructure as a result state has one of worst ratios of evs to chargers countrytesla addressing some of these challenges as it tries to welcome new customers to network without alienating current drivers company adding longer charging cables at new or upgraded supercharger sites to accommodate other models while it has slowed plans to add more supercharger stations it has also promised to focus more on expanding existing onesswitching over to new standard -- which now called nacs north american charging standard since it no longer tesla-exclusive -- will take time a lot of timeadapters are only a temporary solution until automakers start rolling out new evs that are designed to charge at teslas network we work virtually with every [automaker] world says sun of te connectivity whoever wants to sell their vehicle north america they are on this journey to converting to nacsover next year or two companies will start delivering cars with nacs ports built inmeanwhile rival charging companies -- like electrify america others -- are adding nacs plugs to their ports some companies have them already others are promising them within next couple of yearsrick wilmer ceo of charging company chargepoint says having to bring your own adapter a hassle for drivers thats one reason chargepoint has designed chargers with a built-in adapter that can work for both ccs nacs vehiclesbut he said its worth it for industry to switch to a single standard however many years it takes from now when all cars on road are all same all chargers are same thats going to be a better place he saidwilmer for example drives a ford f-150 lightning with a ccs port im not getting rid of it any time soon he pointed out vehicles like his will stay on streets for eight ten 12 15 years wilmer guesseswere going to be living a world of two connectors for a good long time he saidafter all rival technologies dont fade away immediately fun trivia fact last betamax tape was produced 2016,0.14376,positive
317,2024-11-18,robuste kupferabschnitte und neue entdeckung strken die zone tesla,vancouver bc (18 november 2024) - foran mining corporation (tsx fom) (otcqx fmcxf) (foran oder das unternehmen) - https//wwwcommodity-tvcom/ondemand/companies/profil/foran-mining-co  - freut sich weitere kupferhaltige untersuchungsergebnisse aus zwei neuen bohrlchern bekannt zu geben die der zone tesla einem teil des zu 100 % forans besitz befindlichen grundst¬cks mcilvenna bay (das projekt) saskatchewan niedergebracht wurden diese lcher wurden gebohrt um zwei 200 x 300 m groe l¬cken den bohrlochabstnden der nhe der s¬dlichen bekannten rnder der zone tesla zu f¬llen die bohrungen stieen erwartungsgem auf mehrere mineralisierungszonen und besttigten die kontinuitt der zone teslaklicken sie hier um zu sehen wie erin carswell vp exploration von foran die neuesten ergebnisse erlutertdas j¬ngste infill-bohrprogramm der zone tesla sollte das vertrauen den gehalt und die kontinuitt verbessern und gleichzeitig wichtige daten f¬r potenzielle zuk¬nftige ressourcenschtzungen und mgliche betriebliche erweiterungsszenarien liefern (siehe pressemitteilung des unternehmens vom 15 juli 2024) beide bohrlcher durchschnitten das mineralisierte hauptziel gefolgt von dicken kupferreichen abschnitten mit zustzlichem goldgehalt was eine konsistente mineralisierung der gesamten zone besttigt und auf bereiche mit hheren kupfer-gold-gehalten hindeutet insbesondere das bohrloch ts-24-34 deckte eine neue kupfer-zink-mineralisierung unterhalb der aktuellen tesla-linsen auf diese neue mglichkeit unterstreicht die mglichkeit zustzlicher mineralisierter linsen was die wachstumsaussichten von tesla auf dem weg zu einer mglichen zuk¬nftigen ressourcenschtzung verbesserterin carswell vice president exploration bei foran kommentierte diesem sommer experimentierte unser explorationsteam mit neuen techniken die es uns ermglichten tesla zum ersten mal effektiv von der westseite her zu bohren was unsere abhngigkeit von eisbohrungen verringerte und uns einen aufregenden einblick das s¬dliche tesla-fugestein ermglichte den wir bisher noch nicht hatten wie bei der tesla-zone ¬blich gibt es immer wieder berraschungen bohrloch ts-24-34 wurde unter anderem eine neue mineralisierungslinse entdeckt die direkt unterhalb der tesla-hauptlinsen am s¬dlichen ende der zone liegt dar¬ber hinaus zeigen die beiden dieser pressemitteilung vorgestellten bohrlcher einmal mehr wie robust die hauptlinsen von tesla sein knnen da sie mehrere zonen mit hochgradigem kupfer und hochgradigem zink mit einer erfreulichen mchtigkeit der mineralisierung aufweisen die j¬ngsten ergebnisse bei tesla unterstreichen die bemerkenswerte kontinuitt und erffnen mglichkeiten f¬r eine zuk¬nftige wertschpfung f¬r unsere betriebe whrend wir diese vielversprechende zone weiter erkunden- bohrloch ts-24-34 durchschnitt zwei diskrete mineralisierungszonen einschlielich der erwarteten linsen der tesla-zone sowie einer unerwarteten wiederholung von mineralisierten horizonten der unteren verwerfung zu den highlights der hauptlinsen von tesla gehren- die verwerfungswiederholung ts-24-34 umfasste eine d¬nne aber sehr hochgradige massivsulfideinheit gefolgt von einer kupfer-stringer-zone die ergebnisse umfassen- bohrloch ts-24-29 durchschnitt eine breite zone mit einer mineralisierung die durch folgende merkmale gekennzeichnet ist- die planung f¬r ein eisgest¬tztes infill-winterbohrprogramm am hanson lake mit acht bohrgerten das voraussichtlich ende dezember beginnen wird ist im gangeein

dieser pressemitteilung bezug genommen wird sowie die oberflchenprojektionen der interpretierten linsen tesla und mcilvenna bayseit ihrer entdeckung im jahr 2022 hat sich die zone tesla zu einem bedeutenden mineralisierten krper mit einer lnge von 1200 m und einer breite von 500-700 m entwickelt 45 abschnitte (abbildung 1) definieren nun mehrere ¬bereinanderliegende linsen mit kupfer-zink-sulfiden und edelmetallmineralisierungen diese bestehen der regel aus zink- und/oder kupferreichen massiven und halbmassiven sulfiden und damit zusammenhang stehenden kupferreichen stringer-mineralisierungen und hhergradigen brekzienzonen sowie aufkommenden hinweisen auf zonen mit reiner goldmineralisierung die tesla-mineralisierung ist derzeit neigungsabwrts und entlang des streichens weiterhin offen und knnte sich zukunft weiter ausdehnenim sommer/herbst 2024 wurden insgesamt etwa 10810 m bohrungen form einer reihe von pilotbohrungen und keilbohrungen von vier hauptst¬tzen aus durchgef¬hrt die sich im s¬dlichen teil der zone tesla befinden um grere l¬cken den aktuellen bohrlochabstnden zu schlieen und die kontinuitt und den tenor von tesla zu besttigen die bohrlcher wurden auf dem land auf einer streichenlnge von etwa 300 m der zone niedergebracht und von der fuseite aus unter verwendung von richtungsbohrungen gebohrt um senkrechte abschnitte den mineralisierten horizonten zu erhalten im rahmen des programms sommer-herbst 2024 wurden insgesamt sieben tesla-pierce-punkte erzieltin dieser pressemitteilung werden die ergebnisse von zwei bedeutenden bohrlchern (ts-24-29 und ts-24-34) aus dem sommer-infill-bohrprogramm vorgestellt diese bohrlcher zielten auf zwei groe l¬cken den bohrungen ab die beiden fllen etwa 200 m x 300 m entlang des streichens bzw neigungsabwrts messen (abbildung 2) beiden fllen konnte die kontinuitt der mineralisierung mehreren linsen im s¬dlichen teil der zone tesla besttigt werden ts-24-34 durchschnitt auch einen unerwarteten mineralisierungsabschnitt einem unteren verwerfungsabschnitt der sich unterhalb des s¬dlichen endes des tesla-horizonts und der nhe der bridge zone befindet dies knnte mit einer tieferen mineralisierung korrelieren die sporadisch lchern wie ts-23-11w2 und ts-24-290 durchteuft wurde abbildung 2 ist eine karte der bohrdichte dargestellt die die standorte der abschnitte

zielbereichen f¬r infill-bohrungents-24-29 zielte auf eine 200 m x 300 m groe l¬cke zwischen bestehenden bohrlchern ab wo fr¬here bohrungen bedeutende mineralisierungszonen durchschnitten hatten das bohrloch wurde von der fuseite der tesla-zone aus gebohrt sodass es die linsen umgekehrter stratigrafischer reihenfolge durchteufte ts-24-29 durchteufte die erwartete stratigraphie und mineralisierte horizonte die gut mit den umliegenden bohrlchern ¬bereinstimmen die ergebnisse von ts-24-29 stimmen auch gut mit den ergebnissen der zuvor verffentlichten ts-24-30 (etwa 200 m nordstlich gelegen) ¬berein die einen kombinierten 365-meter-abschnitt mit einer stringer-artigen mineralisierung aus der oberen kupferlinse ergab auf die direkt im bohrloch die haupt-massivsulfidlinse und eine dicke zone mit einer stringer-/brekzien-artigen kupfermineralisierung folgt (siehe pressemitteilung von foran vom 7 oktober 2024) ts-24-29 durchschnitt dasselbe mineralisierte paket doch an dieser stelle wurde die untere kupferlinse durch einen spten quarz-feldspat-porphyr-gang (qfp) der von 12803 bis 2835 m die stratigraphie eindrang zwei separate linsen (mit einer lnge von 99 m bzw 262 m) aufgespalten ein querschnitt durch die tesla-zone der die beziehung von ts-24-29 zu den umliegenden bohrlchern zeigt ist abbildung 3 unten dargestelltim detail durchschnitt ts-24-29 eine schmale kupfer-stringer-zone am oberen ende des mineralisierten abschnitts die 20 m lang war und einen gehalt von 076 % cu und 026 g/t au aufwies diese zone korreliert mit einer oberen kupferlinse die sich oberhalb der haupt-massivsulfidlinse befindet wie sie der zuvor verffentlichten ts-24-30 und einem groteil der tesla-zone zu sehen war direkt unterhalb der oberen kupferlinse wurde ein 24 m langer horizont aus massivem bis halbmassivem sulfid mit einem gehalt von 064 % cu 1364 % zn 371 g/t ag und 027 g/t au durchschnitten der vorwiegend aus massivem pyrit mit starkem feinkrnigem sphalerit der grundmasse und einer geringf¬gigen chalkopyritmineralisierung einem stark chloritvernderten muttergestein besteht unterhalb der massivsulfide durchteufte das bohrloch die untere kupferlinse die diesem fall aus mehreren breiten kupferreichen zonen bestand die zumeist aus einer stringerartigen mineralisierung mit lokalen brekzienzonen bestehen die ¬berwiegend aus pyrit und chalkopyrit mit geringem pyrrhotit und sphalerit einem stark blttrigen chlorit- und/oder serizitvernderten felsischen vulkangrundgestein bestehen an diesem standort wird die untere kupferlinse von einem spten qfp-gang durchschnitten der die stratigraphie eingedrungen ist und die untere kupferzone effektiv zwei linsen teilt einen 262 m langen abschnitt mit einem gehalt von 168 % cu gefolgt von einem 99 m langen

dem s¬dlichen ende von tesla das bohrloch durchteufte erfolgreich die zone tesla unmittelbarer nhe der zone bridge dieses bohrloch durchteufte nicht nur die mineralisierten haupthorizonte von tesla und besttigte damit deren kontinuitt sondern durchteufte auch eine zustzliche mineralisierungszone im vergleich zu ts-24-29 die offenbar einen verkr¬mmten versatz und eine wiederholung der tesla-mineralisierung einem interpretierten unteren verwerfungsabschnitt darstellt der wahrscheinlich mit der faltung und verwerfung zusammenhngt die die tesla-zone ihre derzeitige position im verhltnis zur mcilvenna bay gebracht hat diese zustzliche mineralisierungszone wurde auch dem zuvor verffentlichten bohrloch ts-23-11w2 (siehe pressemitteilung von foran vom 25 mai 2023) durchteuft das eine hnliche zusammenhngende mineralisierungszone durchteufte die aus massivsulfid und einer stringerartigen mineralisierung etwa 350 m weiter neigungsabwrts besteht und einen gehalt von 193 % cu 178 % zn und 310 g/t ag auf 44 m aufweist (abbildung 6) diesem gebiet sind weitere bohrungen erforderlich um die ausdehnung dieses mineralisierten horizonts und die beziehung zwischen diesem verwerfungsabschnitt und tesla sowie der zone bridge zu definiereninsgesamt durchteufte ts-24-34 einen 68 m langen abschnitt des linsenfrmigen massivsulfids an der stratigrafischen spitze der tesla-zone das ¬berwiegend aus massivem pyrit mit geringem chalkopyrit und sphalerit einem stark chloritvernderten wirtsgestein besteht und einen gehalt von 162 % kupfer und 484 % zink aufweist direkt unterhalb des massivsulfids durchteufte das bohrloch eine zone mit starken brekzien und stringer-sulfiden ¬ber 84 m die eine bedeutende kupfer- und goldmineralisierung mit einem gehalt von 238 % kupfer und 189 g/t au enthielt dieser abschnitt spricht f¬r das potenzial das bei tesla besteht um weitere hochgradige kupfer-gold-abschnitte zu durchschneiden wenn die infill-bohrungen fortgesetzt werden auf diesen kupfer-gold-abschnitt folgte eine zweite breite zone mit einer ¬berwiegend stringerhnlichen mineralisierung auf 222 m die einen kupfergehalt von 130 % aufwies schlielich durchteufte ts-24-34 einen zustzlichen mineralisierten horizont der fuwand unterhalb von tesla diese fuwandmineralisierung befindet sich im allgemeinen stark blttrigen und rtlich brekzisen einheiten und weist eine hnliche kombination aus einer mineralisierung im stringer-stil und massivsulfid wie bei tesla selbst auf einschlielich 17 m massivsulfid mit einem gehalt von 437 % kupfer und 1547 % zink gefolgt von mehreren schmalen zonen mit brekzien und einer kupfermineralisierung im stringer-stil darunter einschlielich 22 m mit einem gehalt von 152 % kupfer 55 m mit einem gehalt von 111 % kupfer und 39 m

not every ev can use superchargers yet so far only ford rivian gm vehicles have widespread access to network even for those brands some of very oldest superchargers remain tesla-onlymy experience wasnt unique according to jd power non-tesla drivers who access superchargers are not quite as happy with them as tesla drivers are with biggest frustrations being ease of payment of charging but they are still significantly happier with superchargers than they are with fast chargers overalltheres an advantage to a walled garden -- its easier to troubleshoot a system which just one company controls both sides whether its iphones talking to macbooks or a tesla vehicle connecting to a tesla charger more companies with different hardware software that have to communicate means more friction tesla typically does not respond to requests for comment did not reply to inquiries for this story but paul suhey cofounder of revel -- a charging network whose locations are all equipped with both kinds of

but he said companies have made a lot of progress addressing this through standardization its their best interests to work togetherits not just lip service suhey said when you think about companies incentives biggest thing that we want more evs biggest thing that ev manufacturers want more charging so all of that just gets easier more that we standardizefor tesla opening up system means a new revenue source but will it benefit tesla driversin long run this pivot will mean more chargers that they can easily use as their port becomes standard everywhere near term though it means a little more competition for chargers jd power found that since start of 2024 tesla owners have become less satisfied with availability of chargers albeit still very happy with their charging experiencebill lowe a model 3 owner was finishing his fast charge at a supercharger ohio when i pulled up i asked him what he thought about system opening upi think its good he said supercharger network my opinion

327,2024-11-22,tesla won plug war enter age of ev charging adapter,for some us drivers this years hottest car accessory a chunk of black plasticford rivian gave one to each of their ev owners for free general motors selling one for more than $200 drivers of other brands will have to wait until they too can obtain an adapter -- unlock access to promised land of tesla ev chargersmuch like videotape format wars betamax vhs fought 1970s 80s new millennium automakers have vied for dominance over ways to charge evs tesla created a proprietary compact plug design; most other automakers used a shared design for a larger plugthat meant that only tesla owners could plug into expansive tesla supercharger network which available every state offers about 30000 high-speed chargers everyone else relied on a patchwork of other much smaller networks with fewer ports inconsistent charging speeds a reputation for unreliabilitytesla won within last 18 months every other ev maker us has agreed to switch to teslas technology large part because that gives drivers access to industry-leading charging network that tesla builtnow starts a transitional phase which simultaneously slow fastslow because it will take many years for existing cars with rival plugs to be replaced given how long cars last fast because tesla incentivized switch by promising access to its superchargers as brands tap into that once-exclusive network it means an immediate massive increase number of chargers available for their customersthats no small thing auto industry climate advocates lawmakers have all bet heavily on prospect that drivers will embrace evs as superior to gas-powered cars they are -- as auto executives will eagerly tell you -- cheaper to owneasier to maintain quieter speedier charging at home downright convenient but drivers anxiety about charging on go a top reason -- arguably number one reason -- why demand for evs falling short of automakers expectationsthe federal government spending billions to build new chargers to address that anxiety but its off to a slow startmeanwhile teslas network right there waitingso how to get drivers of all of teslas competitors onto teslas networkwhen tesla set out to make a mass-market electric vehicle company knew drivers would want to easily charge on road trips invested heavily its own network of high-speed chargers together car charger became what some call a walled garden -- a standalone proprietary ecosystemin earnings calls over years ceo elon musk has repeatedly said system was not intentionally designed as a walled garden to keep rivals out -- as apple has been accused of doing instead he said teslas design was simply superior other automakers were welcome to get on boardbut companies balked at adopting a competitors technologymost american european carmakers used a shared system called ccs which stands for combined charging system (to make things even more complicated some japanese vehicles used a third standard)qiong sun a charging expert at te connectivity which designs manufactures electrical components to explain difference between teslas system ccs sun holds up a chunk of black plastic with round holes it -- charging inlet of a vehicle on ccs system it has two sections top bottom one used for slower everyday charging like at home or work both sections are used together for fast charging teslas design has just one smaller shape for both types of chargingthis illustrates a fundamental problem to make a tesla supercharger plug fit into a ccs inlet you need an adapter its another chunk of black plastic about 5 inches long which clicks into tesla charging plug on one end cars charging port on other (and because ccs plug different shapes depending on kind of charging you need a separate adapter to use a slower charger with a tesla-style plug)and problem not just as simple as getting pieces to fit together sun says not only does this hardware need to be changed but also now software needs to be able to distinguish which mode it at she says referring to vehicle software that manages battery charginglast but not least tesla needs to give drivers access to charging systemuntil recently without access to superchargers drivers have relied on open networks like electrify america evgo among others surveys from jd power automotive market research firm have consistently found that drivers are less satisfied with non-tesla networks which have far fewer chargers have struggled with reliabilitya spokesperson from electrify america wrote a statement to npr that charging industry still its early stages that company has remained focused on driving customer satisfaction including by replacing more than 800 chargers 2024 a representative from evgo wrote that it has several initiatives to enhance overall customer experience including building larger stations higher-powered chargers since start of 2022 evgo has upgraded replaced or decommissioned legacy equipment at more than 500 stalls across over 20 states to better serve our customers statement saidjd powers data shows satisfaction with non-tesla chargers improving -- although so far not enough to catch up with teslafor a long time this problem didnt affect many people because tesla sold vast majority of evs us but as other automakers scaled up production a growing number of people have been buying those brands there are now some 15 million non-tesla evs on road according to experian -- many of those drivers have been eying teslas walled garden with envyin 2023 a door appeared walled garden white house negotiated with tesla to open a small number of supercharger stations to general public tesla came up with an adapter integrated into those superchargers so drivers could charge vehicles with ccs ports without needing to bring their own adapter exchange tesla became eligible for some of billions federal funds pouring into expanding nations fast-charger networka few months later garden walls started to fall fords ceo appeared on what was then twitter (now x) with elon musk -- owner of both x tesla -- to make surprise announcement that ford was adopting teslas charging technology  exchange getting drivers access to superchargers im really excited about what this means for customers ford ceo jim farley said our goal really to be as helpful as possible accelerating towards sustainable transport musk said latergm followed soon after with a similar announcement then so did all other automakerswhy would companies abandon a standard they had all been using for years give a major coup to their rivalthe answer mostly that car buyers are anxious about road trips majority of time people who own an ev plug it at home or work charge at slower speeds its cheaper easier on car more convenient than stopping to charge of course most drivers spend a lot more time commuting than they do driving long distancesbut on road trips you need to charge much faster thats where teslas supercharger network designed to address this precise anxiety promises to helprivian an all-electric automaker based normal illinois one of first companies to get access to teslas

reaching significant sales milestones like 1 million evs sold by march 2020 its gigafactories are pivotal reducing battery costs further testifying to teslas role as a leader pushing boundaries of technology sustainability automotive worldtesla under visionary leadership of elon musk -- who also serves as a key advisor to president trump -- has unveiled ambitious plans for a fully autonomous robo-taxi aptly named cybercab with a regulatory landscape evolving to be more favorable to self-driving technology musks timeline of a 2026 rollout for cybercab could very well be within reach provided technical hurdles are navigated successfully trump administration reportedly pushing for a robust federal framework that would pave way for fully autonomous vehicles -- those devoid of traditional driving controls like steering wheels pedals this groundbreaking development could accelerate debut of such vehicles potentially rewriting rules of road travelhowever this shift spells a potential challenge for ride-sharing giants uber lyft while teslas stock basks glow of favorable news uber lyft have found themselves on back foot shares of uber lyft have fallen roughly by 10% since election signaling investor concerns that an autonomous future could disrupt traditional ride-sharing models this scenario underscores a pivotal moment transportation -- a shift that could redefine winners losers this high-stakes race to autonomyteslas potential release of a fully autonomous cybercab could catalyze a monumental shift across several industries particularly insurance sector many vehicle owners might forego burdens of ownership like high maintenance insurance costs favor of using a cybercab this change could ripple through insurance industry as traditional policies become less necessary moreover cybercab offers an intriguing investment prospect -- not just for individuals but also for companies pension funds by owning fleets of these autonomous vehicles investors could tap into a new stream of income fundamentally altering investment strategies within transportation domain such a shift would also pose significant challenges to established ride-sharing models threatening companies like uber lyft with a more efficient potentially cheaper alternativebelievers this tesla-centric reality maintain that it will propel stock much higher cynics believe that this type of technology still distant future regulatory hurdles are still very highsince president trumps victory 2024 election teslas stock has soared by an impressive 28% president trump has shown his confidence elon musk by appointing him to lead a new department of government efficiency aimed at cutting wasteful spending slicing through burdensome regulations this strategic move could further accelerate teslas innovative projects including autonomous cybercab propelling company to new heights redefining urban mobility as we know ithere are teslas revenue earnings metrics over past several years even critics are forced to admit that these numbers are super impressivein last 4 years revenue has increased 204% while earnings have grown 2074%elon musk has long championed artificial intelligence (ai) autonomous driving technology as cornerstone of teslas future expansion with robust government support investors are closely watching hopeful that musks strategic focus will culminate substantial gains solidifying teslas leadership innovative automotive technologiesthis melding of futuristic vision regulatory backing could very well be recipe for a spectacular success story tech-driven auto industryin this stock study we will look at an analysis of following indicators metrics which are our guidelines which dictate our behavior deciding whether to buy sell or stand aside on a particular stockwhile we make all our decisions based upon artificial intelligence forecasts we do look at fundamentals briefly just to understand financial landscape that $tsla operating inwall street analysts forecastsover past three months 29 wall street analysts have been scrutinizing tesla motors with their 12-month price targets ranging significantly average target sits at $23382 soaring to a high of $400 plunging to a low of just $2486 this stark disparity -- over $375 or 108% of current price -- underscores expected volatility highlights why tesla seen as such a turbulent stock for those looking to invest tesla its crucial to be prepared for substantial fluctuations this spread valuations isnt just noise; its indicative of deeply divergent views on teslas financial health market trajectory a scenario that seasoned traders might describe as having volatility baked in52 week high low boundariessavvy traders always keep their eyes on 52-week high low of stocks to gauge their annual performance these thresholds are not just numbers; they are essential indicators of a stocks strength weakness over year tesla demonstrated a striking range from a low of $13880 to a high of $35864 this past year thats a substantial variance of $21984 amounting to 64% of its recent closing price this wide range offers traders a clear view of stocks historical volatility helps them strategize accordinglythe first thing we can notice as traders that this historical volatility of 64% often limits uninterrupted rallies declines to values which tightly mimic these seismic movesto truly appreciate impressive journey of tesla ($tsla) we need to zoom out consider its performance over last decade this long-term view reveals a staggering peak price of $41440 a low of just $940 as traders our focus homed on performance metrics like these -- everything else secondary tesla continues to captivate our attention not only due to its remarkable market achievements but also because of compelling narrative significant developments surrounding company tesla ($tsla) scaling remarkably well while massive challenges remain it hard to bet against elon musk based upon successes he has hadbest-case/worst-case analysisin stock market volatility can be a perplexing often harsh reality for traders particularly when they find themselves on losing end to get a real handle on what volatility means action we analyze compare magnitude of stocks uninterrupted rallies declines over past year analyzing stocks most significant uninterrupted rallies declines over past year can reveal much about its behavior under extreme conditions this isnt just about observing numbers; its about understanding broader implications of these movements for crafting strategies that acknowledge stocks potential for large price swings such an analysis helps traders not only prepare for future volatility but also develop a trading framework that respects full spectrum of market emotions from bullish optimism to bearish pessimism thereby equipping them with insights to potentially profit from market volatility while being mindful of risksfirst we look at best-case scenario by measuring largest uninterrupted rallies over past 52 weeksnext we do inverse measure largest uninterrupted declines over past yearthe charts for tesla ($tsla) clearly highlight bullish trend dominating its market presence but they also bring to light stocks inherent volatility with possible downturns reaching as much as 47% spikes as high as 66% mere weeks this visual analysis pivotal for traders offering a balanced view of risks rewards involved with teslas stock moreover comparing teslas performance against broader market indices sharpens our understanding of its relative strength or weakness allowing traders to align their strategies with both teslas specific movements broader market dynamics this comparative approach essential for traders looking to navigate through teslas price fluctuations global market shifts with informed precisionwhen we compare $tsla to broader market we see that it has outperformed across all of time framesto get more granular we often like to see how a company performed against top competitors its niche below a performance analysis of $tsla against 5 of its major competitorsthe 5-year beta of tesla ($tsla) approximately 230 so it 130% more volatile than broader market indexesimagine youre playing a video game where your goal to follow a moving line as closely as possible this moving line represents overall stock market if you follow it perfectly you move exactly as line does; this like having a beta of 10 where your movements (or stock price changes) perfectly match markets ups downsnow tesla has a beta of about 230 this means if market goes up by 1% teslas stock likely to go up by about 230% conversely if market goes down by 1% teslas stock might go down by about 230% this higher beta indicates that teslas stock more volatile or swings more dramatically compared to overall market so our video game analogy if tesla your character its moving much faster more wildly than line youre trying to follow this can make tesla a riskier choice but also potentially more rewarding if youre good at anticipating when those big moves happenvantagepoint ai predictive triple cross indicatora basic moving average (ma) strategy a fundamental tool

335,2024-11-18,every tesla cybertruck recall 2024,tesla didnt invent electric vehicles but it launched ev revolution many other companies had attempted to sell electric cars through decades but tesla was first to succeed part of teslas success came from charisma of its ceo de-facto mascot elon musk more than any other automotive executive industry including henry ford lee iococca elon musk used his own persona to promote his companys carsbut after a few years of dizzying success things started to look wobbly for man behind ev elon musks reputation first faltered when tesla released first concept renderings of cybertruck which apparently was musks passion project ever since first cgi drawings went public automotive enthusiasts have delighted disparaging teslas first truck pontiac aztek a popular comparison but aztek doesnt have a history of shedding body panels onto highwaythe cybertrucks polarizing appearance long delays uneven rollout put first cracks elon musks previously unassailable reputation (musks management of x formerly known as twitter has driven a longer stake through what remained of his popularity) after such a troubled development cycle it was almost surprising when cybertruck finally hit dealer lots instead of getting postponed yet again but now that cybertruck has been on sale for quite some time heres everytime it has been recalled this

didnt really get standardized until a few decades after cars went mainstream however pressing a pedal footwell has made car go faster since beginning but even though pedals have been a solved technology for over a century tesla managed to mess it updue to what tesla calls an unapproved change company began using soap as an assembly lubricant while putting together cybertrucks accelerator pedals as a result pad of pedal can become detached from rest of it pad can then get trapped between main body of pedal cybertrucks distinctively polygonal interior trim this can cause cybertruck to accelerate whether driver wants to or not regardless of whether tesla discreetly half-approved creative use of soap on its production lines  company has since found out why no one else automotive industry does itfortunately for cybertruck drivers anyone on road near them they will not be trapped a runaway vehicle pressing brake pedal will bring cybertruck to a stop one simply needs to ignore all warning lights that some from simultaneously pressing accelerator brakesthe repair tesla will reassemble pedalon june 18 (that two months one day after recall was issued) tesla mailed out notices to cybertruck owners they will reassemble repair pedals free of charge one can assume that there will be no further unapproved use of soap assembly2 june 19 2024 front windshield wiper can failto be fair to tesla windshield wipers are a new technology compared to accelerator pedals but before one gets too generous with ones pardons windshield wipers are powered by electric motors at this point it worth noting (again) that tesla got its start by making first popular vehicles that were powered by electric motors instead of enginesnevertheless texas-based automaker has had a few difficulties with little electric motor under windshield that makes wipers go back forth motor controller can fail at any time leaving driver stuck with motionless wipers that block view on a clear day are useless rain this caused by excessive current going to motors controller which can more or less fry its electronic circuitsthe repair tesla will replace windshield wiper motor controllertesla replacing wiper motor its corresponding controller free of charge presumably this replacement contains some sort of current limiter to prevent replacement parts from shuffling off to salvage heap same way as their predecessors or perhaps some fundamentally redesigned circuitryit rather striking that teslas second cybertruck recall of 2024 was due to well-cooked circuit boards tesla has almost (but not quite) billed itself as an electronics company that makes cars instead of computers therefore it interesting that it didnt manage to prevent a relatively basic issue like overloading circuit boards with too much electricity229relatedthis why cybertruck has a rusting problemtheres more than meets eye when looking at tesla cybertrucks current rusting problem3 june 19 2024 improperly adhered trunk bed trim can detachcybertrucks are molting all over highways what official literature calls sail appliqu flying off of truck effectively becoming futuristic shrapnel for nearby drivers for those who have never heard term so-called sail appliqu a piece of black paneling on top of cybertrucks bed rails without it rain road detritus can freely land inside bed wallsit worth noting that most other trucks have no such trim pieces at all outer inner sides of other truck beds meet with a single-seamed joint however tesla decided to shift a few paradigms by adding a flat piece between inner outer body panels exploring this previously uncharted territory of body design tesla did not quite manage to make a truck bed that could hold itself togetherit may be tempting to speculate that teslas groundbreaking use of stainless steel body panels has made it difficult to attach cladding paneling to vehicle however tesla not first automaker to use stainless steel even delorean a short-lived company that was not known for making durable cars (back to future endorsement notwithstanding) managed to produce vehicles that held onto all of their trim while drivingthe repair tesla will remove replace sail appliquestesla removing replacing sail appliques free of charge however longevity of this repair dubious at best according to teslas own technical service bulletins trim panels question are held on exclusively with push-nuts clips granted many cars use clips push-nuts to attach exterior cladding to main body however most other automakers tend to put a few sturdy bolts onto each trim piece tesla chose not to do this4 september 26 2024 rearview camera image may not display/fmvss 111fmvss (federal moving vehicle safety standards) 111 pertains to rear visibility including windows mirrors cameraslike an internet video loading over a bad connection screen showing view through rearview camera can have a delay this means that cybertruck drivers may not see any hazards for a few seconds after they appear of course danger behind this should be obviousit may be tempting to cut tesla a bit of slack say that rearview cameras are relatively new however they have been standard cars for many years first rearview cameras may have had their technological hiccups but they are now as dependable as speedometers (unless one drives a cybertruck)the repair an over-the-air software updatefortunately for cybertruck owners this a problem that will effectively solve itself tesla sent a software update over air to fix rear cameras delay tesla may have difficulty getting its camera software to work properly before deployment but it can at least fix its problems at no further inconvenience to its customers concerned cybertruck owners can of course verify that their vehicle received software update but if all goes well this recall will not force anyone to take their cybertruck to a tesla dealer wait for it to be fixeddiscussionhow dangerous tesla cybertruckive logged onto twitter (x) many times to see videos of emergency personnel struggling to get into cybertruck reports from drivers saying this thing a death trap however how much of that true i know cybertruck isnt best fine but how dangerous do you think this electric pickup really to everyday drivers passengers where are federal safety ratings5 november 4 2024 inverter fault may cause loss of drive powerthe inverter that supplies ac electricity to cybertrucks motor can go out without warning rendering motor useless as official notice tactfully puts it on affected vehicles a fault drive inverter may cause it to stop producing torque other words cybertruck can suddenly die without so much as a warning light when this happens only option to get off road before cybertruck coasts to a stop this way cybertruck owners can share experience of any ice driver whose oil warning light has turned onthe repair tesla will replace drive invertertesla replacing inverter free of chargegiven that tesla released its first production model 2008  it astounding that company should have such a stunning powertrain failure after so many years while tesla may be constantly introducing radically new technologies to automotive industry (sometimes with success) it has been using electric motors to propel cars for a long time tesla no longer scrappy upstart of automotive industry it truly stunning that at this late stage companys development elon musk would sign off on a powertrain that suddenly dies middle of road particularly when it installed what most tesla fans have come to understand his

336,2024-11-22,verr¬ckter chef gutes auto das moralische dilemma der tesla-fahrer,elon musks unterst¬tzung f¬r trump und seine politischen aussagen kratzen auch am image von tesla viele fragen sich

prangen knnte elon musk solange musk chef ist werde ich mir keinen tesla mehr kaufen sagt maximilian einen wie musk wolle er finanziell nicht mehr unterst¬tzener ist damit nicht der einzige sptestens seit sich musk offen f¬r donald trump aussprach nun sogar dessen regierungsteam beitrat und nebenbei mit seinen zunehmend radikalen aussagen auf social media auffllt brckelt f¬r viele das image von tesla ich kaufte dieses auto bevor ich herausfand dass elon verr¬ckt ist steht auf aufklebern die sich einige e-auto-fahrer den usa neuerdings als rechtfertigung hinten aufs auto kleben oder ich liebe das auto nicht elon auch einige firmen wenden sich mittlerweile von tesla ab sollte man chef und produkt lieber trennen oder schadet ein tesla-kauf mittlerweile mehr dem klima wenn musk einen klimawandelleugner wie trump unterst¬tztf¬r maximilian ist der besitz eines tesla ein wachsender kampf mit dem eigenen gewissen schon vor einem jahr wusste ich dass musk eher konservativ ist aber das war noch irgendwie verkraftbar sagt der 28-jhrige informatiker aus deutschland der seinen vollen namen nicht verffentlichen mchte heute wisse jeder dass musk trump unterst¬tze und gegen minderheiten und transpersonen hetze da ich einen tesla fahre kommt das thema auch gesprchen mit der familie und mit freunden immer wieder auf was ist denn mit deinem elon los werde er dann gefragt ich f¬hle mich zwar nicht persnlich davon angegriffen aber schn ist das nicht das immer wieder zu hren sagt maximilianhnliche gedanken plagen auch sven lohmann seit drei jahren fahre er mit einem e-auto von mercedes bis vor kurzem sei f¬r ihn klar gewesen dass das neue auto ein tesla wird weil er mit der reichweite und technik der autos die er bisher nur gelegentlich mietete immer zufrieden war mittlerweile komme ich immer mehr ins hadern sagt der 39-jhrige der als medizin-controller bochum deutschland arbeitet ich habe den typen immer schon als leicht irre wahrgenommen aber seit seiner hetze gegen auslnder und seiner unterst¬tzung f¬r trump frage ich mich ob ich das noch mit meinen grundprinzipien vereinbaren kann er knne guten gewissens keinen tesla mehr kaufendabei war elon musk f¬r tesla lange zeit vor allem segen statt fluch f¬r viele galt und gilt musk als visionr dessen utopische techniktrume die menschheit um groe schritte voranbringen w¬rden der eine lsung f¬r die mobilittswende bot und das e-auto von der ko-nische den mainstream befrderte wohl keine andere automarke und ihr image sind heute so eng mit ihrem chef verbunden wie tesla mit musk elon musk stand lange symbolhaft f¬r tesla und f¬r eine positive zukunft sagt stefan bratzel direktor des center of automotive management (cam) bergisch gladbach das zur automobilitt forschtden bruch mit diesem image sieht bratzel vor zwei jahren als elon musk f¬r 44 milliarden dollar twitter kaufte seither uert sich musk zunehmend politisch zu themen wie meinungsfreiheit oder wokeness was vielen missfllt seine offene unterst¬tzung f¬r trump habe gerade europa viele menschen abgeschreckt die trump kritisch gegen¬berstehen die aussagen von musk belasten mittlerweile das image von tesla das knnte die verkufe gerade europa negativ beeinflussen sagt bratzelbei jenen die zwischen mehreren marken schwanken knnte das verhalten von musk ausschlag daf¬r geben sich gegen tesla zu entscheiden das gelte vor allem f¬r das liberale und intellektuelle milieu das damals zu den ersten tesla-kufern gehrte und f¬r das die werte einer marke eine groe bedeutung f¬r den autokauf haben sagt bratzel nach auen hin ist tesla heute nicht mehr die strahlende marke die sie einst war sondern wird zunehmend kritischer gesehendass sich das negativ auf die verkaufszahlen der e-autos auswirken knnte hngt auch mit dem sozialen druck zusammen das bedeutet je mehr freunde verwandte oder bekannte ein e-auto ablehnen desto eher wird man sich auch selbst dagegen entscheiden zu diesem ergebnis kommt eine internationale studie aus diesem jahr f¬r die forschende 791 personen deutschland chile und spanien zu ihrem autokauf befragten die meinungen und der einfluss aus dem umfeld habe sogar den grten effekt auf das kaufverhaltenes ist ein effekt der sich mglicherweise nicht nur bei privatkufern sondern auch bei unternehmen zeigen knnte die drogeriekette rossmann teilte k¬rzlich etwa mit dass sie ab sofort keine weiteren tesla-fahrzeuge mehr kaufen werde die aussagen von musk seien mit den werten von tesla nicht mehr vereinbar wenn musk trump unterst¬tze der den klimawandel wiederholt als schwindel bezeichnete stehe das krassem gegensatz zur mission von tesla durch die produktion von elektroautos einen beitrag zum umweltschutz zu leistenauch die vorarlberger photovoltaikfirma hansesun k¬ndigte nach der erneuten wahl von trump zum us-prsidenten an ihre flotte an tesla-dienstwagen zu verkaufen und keine neuen autos der marke mehr anzuschaffen mit der unterst¬tzung von trump katapultiere musk bem¬hungen f¬r den klimaschutz und die energiewende um jahre zur¬ck begr¬ndete das unternehmen seine entscheidunggro treffen d¬rfte das tesla derzeit noch nicht immerhin hlt sich die zahl an tesla-firmenwagen der beiden unternehmen stark grenzen und auch die breite masse an privatkuferinnen und privatkufern hat sich vom politischen verhalten musks bisher nicht abschrecken lassen zuletzt sind die tesla-verkufe weltweit wieder gestiegen im vergleich zur ersten jahreshlfte und nach dem wahlsieg von donald trump hat die tesla-aktie innerhalb von vier tagen um mehr als 40 prozent zugelegthinzu kommt dass e-autos zunehmend breitere schichten erobern die weniger geld haben und denen das preis-leistungs-verhltnis wichtiger ist als die politischen einstellungen der firmenchefs sagt bratzel und gerade beim preis-leistungs-verhltnis spielt tesla noch eine starke rollein summe sei das auftreten musks dennoch eher schdlich f¬r tesla glaubt bratzel f¬r tesla wre es wahrscheinlich besser wenn sich musk mit seinen politischen aussagen etwas zur¬ckhlt im stark demokratischen us-bundesstaat kalifornien etwa gingen die tesla-verkufe diesem jahr um mehrere prozent zur¬ck obwohl die verkufe von elektroautos insgesamt stiegen auch hier ist der verlust jedoch noch ¬berschaubar tesla macht immer noch mehr als die hlfte der verkufe an e-autos kalifornien auser habe freunde die weiterhin tesla fahren und denen egal ist was elon musk tut oder sagt sagt sven lohmann menschen die das auto aus rein technischen gesichtspunkten betrachten oder sich fragen was es ndern w¬rde wenn sie jetzt keinen tesla kaufen und dann stattdessen jemand anderer das auto kauftbis kommenden mrz wenn sein aktuelles e-auto zur¬ckgeht hat lohmann noch mit seiner entscheidung zeit ob das neue auto ein tesla wird oder nicht lediglich eines wei er bereits sicher dass er nicht mehr zur¬ck zum diesel will und immerhin zu dieser gewissheit d¬rfte auch tesla - musks image hin oder her - einen beitrag geleistet haben

341,2024-11-22,tesla won plug war enter age of ev charging adapter,jd powers data shows satisfaction with non-tesla chargers improving -- although so far not enough to catch up with teslafor a long time this problem didnt affect many people because tesla sold vast majority of evs us but as other automakers scaled up production a growing number of people have been buying those brands there are now some 15 million non-tesla evs on road according to experian -- many of those drivers have been eying teslas walled garden with envyin 2023 a door appeared walled garden white house negotiated with tesla to open a small number of supercharger stations to general public tesla came up with an adapter integrated into those superchargers so drivers could charge vehicles with ccs ports without needing to bring their own adapter exchange tesla became eligible for some of billions federal funds pouring into expanding nations fast-charger networka few months later garden walls started to fall fords ceo appeared on what was then twitter (now x) with elon musk -- owner of both x tesla -- to make surprise announcement that ford was adopting teslas charging technology  exchange getting drivers access to superchargers im really excited about what this means for customers ford ceo jim farley said our goal really to be as helpful as possible accelerating towards sustainable transport musk said latergm followed soon after with a similar announcement then so did all other automakerswhy would companies abandon a standard they had all been using for years give a major coup to their rivalthe answer mostly that car buyers are anxious about road trips majority of time people who own an ev plug it at home or work charge at slower speeds its cheaper easier on car more convenient than stopping to charge of course most drivers spend a lot more time commuting than they do driving long distancesbut on road trips you need to charge much faster thats where teslas supercharger network designed to address this precise anxiety promises to helprivian an all-electric automaker based normal illinois one of first companies to get access to teslas chargers building out an ecosystem of charging locations to allow drivers to get to where they need to go a cornerstone of increasing ev adoption rivian vice president paul frey told npr a statement he called accessing tesla supercharger network an important step this journeyso i put networks promise to test by driving through pennsylvania ohio on a round trip of nearly 900 miles a borrowed rivian r1s suv while r1s still being built with a ccs charging port company supplied me with an adapter i programmed infotainment system to route me to whatever chargers made sense tesla includedmy first pennsylvania charging stop -- not at a tesla station -- had four chargers as i pulled up a repairman was already there (in an electric pickup truck naturally) at work troubleshooting he didnt want to give his name because he wasnt authorized to talk to press but did tell me that chargers were a little finicky three out of four werent working properlylater on trip i stopped at a different competitors charging station also with four chargers three of them were occupied last one out of orderevery supercharger i visited contrast had at least 12 chargers at least 8 of them open every one i tried worked they were fast there were so many of them having superchargers available tripled number of 150 kw chargers available to me on one 7-hour stretch of my drive this case grass really was greener on other side of that garden wallive charged teslas at superchargers before plugging rivian wasnt quite as seamless of course theres an adapter to wrangle i also encountered some trouble starting charge just by plugging had to ultimately use tesla app rivian says that was an isolated glitch possibly tied to me using a loaner vehicleparking non-tesla vehicles can also be tricky or at least an etiquette minefield charger ports are a different spot on different vehicles tesla chargers were designed well for teslas that means you often have to take up two spaces to charge one carand not every ev can use superchargers yet so far only ford rivian gm vehicles have widespread access to network even for those brands some of very oldest superchargers remain tesla-onlymy experience wasnt unique according to jd power non-tesla drivers who access superchargers are not quite as happy with them as tesla drivers are with biggest frustrations being ease of payment of charging but they are still significantly happier with superchargers than they are with fast chargers overalltheres an advantage to a walled garden -- its easier to troubleshoot a system which just one company controls both sides whether its iphones talking to macbooks or a tesla vehicle connecting to a tesla charger more companies with different hardware software that have to communicate means more friction tesla typically does not respond to requests for comment did not reply to inquiries for this story but paul suhey cofounder of revel -- a charging network whose locations are all equipped with both kinds of ports -- said that its undeniable that opening up a charger network to more brands adds complexityi think 100% you have advantages when you have compatibility between charger vehicle itself said suhey but he said companies have made a lot of progress addressing this through standardization its their best interests to work togetherits not just lip service suhey said when you think about companies incentives biggest thing that we want more evs biggest thing that ev manufacturers want more charging so all of that just gets easier more that we standardizefor tesla opening up system means a new revenue source but will it benefit tesla driversin long run this pivot will mean more chargers that they can easily use as their port becomes standard everywhere near term though it means a little more competition for chargers jd power found that since start of 2024 tesla owners have become less satisfied with availability of chargers albeit still very happy with their charging experiencebill lowe a model 3 owner was finishing his fast charge at a supercharger ohio when i pulled up i asked him what he thought about system opening upi think its good he said supercharger network my opinion teslas secret sauce as long as access to chargers fair stations dont get all clogged up with long lines of cars he said he thinks its a positive changethat said for lowe long lines are only a hypothetical problem he lives tennessee a part of country where ev adoption low ive never had a problem with pulling up to a supercharger thats been full yet he saiddrivers california might have a very different experience as of mid-2024 34% of all nations registered evs were california 25% of nations charging infrastructure as a result state has one of worst ratios of evs to chargers countrytesla addressing some of these challenges as it tries to welcome new customers to network without alienating current drivers company adding longer charging cables at new or upgraded supercharger sites to accommodate other models while it has slowed plans to add more supercharger stations it has also promised to focus more on expanding existing onesswitching over to new standard -- which now called nacs north american charging standard since it no longer tesla-exclusive -- will take time a lot of timeadapters are only a temporary solution until automakers start rolling out new evs that are designed to charge at teslas network we work virtually with every [automaker] world says sun of te connectivity whoever wants to sell their vehicle north america they are on this journey to converting to nacsover next year or two companies will start delivering cars with nacs ports built inmeanwhile rival charging companies -- like electrify america others -- are adding nacs plugs to their ports some companies have them already others are promising them within next couple of yearsrick wilmer ceo of charging company chargepoint says having to bring your own adapter a hassle for drivers thats one reason chargepoint has designed chargers with a built-in adapter that can work for both ccs nacs vehiclesbut he said its worth it for industry to switch to a single standard however many years it takes from now when all cars on road are all same all chargers are same thats going to be a better place he saidwilmer for example drives a ford f-150 lightning with a ccs port im not getting rid of it any time soon he pointed out vehicles like his will stay on streets for eight ten 12 15 years wilmer guesseswere going to be living a world of two connectors for a good long time he saidafter all rival technologies

that one of older years was best year to buy you might be let down when you hear that 2024 model y takes reigns while you wont be saving money over others since 2024 model currently newest model you can buy plus side it does almost everything better than its older counterparts such as least recallsonly two recalls popped up on 2024 model yall 2024 tesla model y trims variants received an overall safety rating of five out of five stars regarding recalls 2024 model y by far best choice of year with its two recalls recalls inside outside car world sound bad but it doesnt always mean its end of world or model unreliable 2024 model y a prime example of this with its two recalls being minor compared to others these two recalls consist of a software bug where hood could open increasing risk of a crash an incorrect font size on warning lights first recall might sound bad but most manufacturers find ways to fix it by calling owners to receive a car service to eliminate threatthe earlier models were guinea pigsits known within car world that buying first year of a new generation isnt always best decision this because manufacturers are still ironing out kinks your best bet to buy some of newer models of course if you wait too long youre left with one of new models right before a new generation emerges tesla model y provides another good example which shows 2020 model receiving 21 recalls following year receiving 20 while it took tesla a couple of years to fix these issues 2024 model y seems to be less stressful year with minimal recallsrelated10 reasons why this ev outselling

or picking up one of its models 2024 model y for instance comes three trims long range rear-wheel drive long range all-wheel drive performance all-wheel drive youd most likely be right if you had to bet on what each trim offers tesla offers base rear-wheel-drive trim at $44990 long-range all-wheel drive at $47990 performance at $51490 these prices can even be lower for some who qualify for $7500 federal tax credit five-year gas savings of $6000both tesla model y showcase innovative technology designwhen you think of innovation within automotive world many peoples minds go to electrified vehicles there are several reasons for this but main takeaways are futuristic designs inventive technology tesla one of companies that constantly pushing towards future when it comes to design technology model y attests to this through its simple but sleek contoursthe model ys design isnt just for looks but also optimizes its aerodynamics regarding its technology model y comes with abundant driver aids convenient tech within infotainment system while model y already showcases some impressive technology it was only a matter of time until tesla started implementing rocket science one of its modelsadd topspeed to your google news feedfollow ongoogle newsthe electric midsize suv that demonstrates class-leading efficiencythere wouldnt be a discussion over a tesla if its fuel efficiency wasnt brought up while things can be repetitive within automotive world an evs range will always be a point to discuss model ys range fluctuates given year of model if you were to compare each year on long range trim you would see that 2024 model provides lowest range which comes out at 310 miles meanwhile previous two years 2022 2023 offered 330 miles if youre keen on added horsepower performance

costs)the tesla model y returns some of lowest energy charging costs thanks to its low-efficiency estimatesjd power gave model y an overall rating of 76 out of 100so what decides which year best for a particular model there isnt really a correct answer; instead there are various things to note that could persuade you that it best year if youre aiming for recalls which this case basis of which year succeeds over each other then youd want to go with 2024 model y if you want to see 2024 model y a bigger picture then take jd powers analysis of it 2024 model y received an overall score of 76 out of 100 which branches off into a couple of categories one area included its reliability which scored 69 out of 100 other two were driving experience 81 out of 100 resale projection 85 out of 100you can expect high ownership costsanother area that doesnt hurt to look at when youre market for a car its ownership costs before breaking it down 2024 tesla model y projected to cost you $30001 out-of-pocket expenses after five years these expenses include several areas such as maintenance which will cost you $3115 repairs which cost $2510 after five years insurance runs high as well with it being projected to cost owners $18180 some might think $30001 after five years doable but five-year cost to own a 2024 tesla model y doubles will cost you $60349the model y prone to depreciate over timethe tesla model y prone to losing its car value over time but theres a catch generally most evs depreciate higher than traditional internal combustion engine cars (ice) but thats another topic of discussion youll see a drastic loss first year of owning model y with a price tag of around $44000 just after one year value of your car now sits at $30348 after five years it gets even worse with projections going as low as $14282 so yes tesla model y prone to depreciation but from looks of it most tesla owners look past this issuethe tesla model y a well-sought-after model on market 2024 model looks to be a solid candidate another area worth mentioning that even though it doesnt excel regions that older models do it does come with most up-to-date tech design batteries if you cant swing 2024 model other good news that each model seems to prosper one area compared to its other years basically not one year perfect or shines over rest,0.19455,positive

tesla empez a vender automviles consigui un crdito fiscal de us$ 7500 para compradores de vehculos elctricos que les permiti a la empresa y a otros fabricantes de automviles vender vehculos elctricos fabricados en estados unidos a un precio m­s alto del que el mercado habra permitido de otra maneracmo el departamento de eficiencia gubernamental de trump y musk podra reprimir el trabajo remoto y forzar a los empleados federales a renunciarlos compradores de tesla recibieron crditos fiscales federales por un valor estimado de us$ 3400 millones antes de que el beneficio desapareciera por completo para los compradores de tesla a fines de 2019 incluso si eso solo le permiti a tesla aumentar los precios a la mitad de esa cantidad eso representa otros us$ 1700 millones en ayuda federal cuando la compaña enfrentaba una crisis de efectivoel crdito fiscal se restableci en 2023 como parte de la ley de reduccin de la inflacin de la administracin de biden sin embargo musk alent a la administracin entrante de trump a poner fin al crdito fiscal de us$ 7500 lo que parecera ir en contra de los intereses de tesla pero sera un golpe para los fabricantes de automviles establecidos que buscan obtener una participacin en el mercado estadounidense de vehculos elctricos esos fabricantes de automviles tradicionales tendran que aceptar mayores prdidas en sus ventas de vehculos elctricos o reducir sus ofertas lo que reducira la competencia para teslaquiten los subsidios eso solo ayudar­ a tesla public musk en su plataforma de redes sociales x en juliobeneficios financieros por la regulacin sobre vehculos elctricospero el apoyo financiero m­s importante de tesla no proviene de los crditos fiscales para los compradores de vehculos elctricos sino de la venta de crditos regulatorios que otros fabricantes de automviles compran para cumplir con las regulaciones estatales y federales destinadas a reducir los gases de efecto invernaderoel dinero no proviene de los contribuyentes pero sin la regulacin gubernamental no habra miles de millones fluyendo a las arcas de teslaesas ventas a crdito literalmente mantuvieron encendidas las luces de tesla y permitieron que sus cheques de pago se cobraran durante los primeros das de la empresa representaron casi el 25% de sus ingresos en 2008 y el 10% de sus ingresos durante los siguientes cinco añosentre 2008 y 2019 las

352,2024-11-18,tesla full self driving continues to improve exponentially,teslas full self-driving (fsd) software has been a subject of immense curiosity excitement sometimes skepticism yet progress tesla has made developing refining fsd nothing short of remarkable during a panel discussion on hans nelsons youtube channel titled teslas insane fsd progress tesla experts investors hans nelson herbert ong jeff lutz discussed latest fsd advancements shedding light on exponential improvements tesla has achieved challenges that lie aheadtesla has a really good ability to sort real-time issues as they come from drivers said herbert ong he praised companys data-driven approach which has been instrumental refining fsd at an unprecedented pace with version 12521 already deployed to 50000 vehicles ong explained that teslas responsiveness to user feedback has made their software continually better progress really good its interesting to see how quickly theyve addressed things like abrupt stopping at yellow lights or hesitation at green lights -- all things that drivers have been reporting ong addedrecent updates whats nextone of most notable milestones discussed during panel was full rollout of end-to-end highway driving to all ai hardware 4 users which targeted for early next week theyve enhanced stop smoothness reduced annoying weather notifications introduced various safety improvements said jeff lutz version 125x continues to refine city driving smart summon has now been released to europe china other international markets -- a testament to teslas ambition to make their technology globally adaptablehowever ong also touched on elephant room there are some features that were planned for october like unpark park reverse capabilities which havent yet been fully rolled out he emphasized that although tesla fell behind on these particular features sheer scale of we robot event which took place mid-october might have been reason for delay despite some setbacks ong remarked even if all of this gets pushed to december or january bigger picture that these engineering problems have solutions tesla will deliverharnessing data to drive improvementthe role of data cannot be overstated when it comes to teslas fsd improvements amount of information theyre getting from fleet pretty significant lutz said were talking about roughly 50000 vehicles on version 1256 when you have datasets this large it becomes much easier to identify product performance trends real-time he explained that analyzing large data sets crucial for understanding how system performing where it can be improved when youre dealing with millions of data points you get a much clearer picture compared to smaller more discrete datasets lutz addedthis approach to iterative testing data collection enables tesla to identify issues quickly adjust course where necessary which has been a driving factor their progress teslas ability to validate these changes through large-scale data analysis really sets them apart noted onghardware 4 ai4 unleashing new capabilitiesteslas hardware 4 coupled with latest ai4 models represents a significant leap forward companys self-driving capabilities ai4 hardware has not only a faster computer but also higher resolution cameras said nelson up until now theyve only been emulating hardware 3 cameras but now theyre taking training wheels off running ai4 full native resolution this upgrade enables tesla to fully leverage compute power higher-resolution imagery that ai4 offers over previous hardware versionsnelson also addressed a common concern among tesla owners about hardware 3s ability to keep up with future software updates management has mentioned that while they are developing at cutting edge with ai4 they will eventually backport these improvements to hardware 3 nelson explained there are millions of hardware 3 vehicles on road which makes it worthwhile to compress models adapt them for older platform he added that if necessary tesla could retrofit older vehicles with upgraded computers -- a complex but feasible solutionimprovements version 13 next leapversion 13 of fsd poised to make substantial improvements across board theyve already said that version 13 has a four-times increase miles between necessary interventions compared to version 1254 lutz pointed out this version expected to be delivered to internal customers imminently with a wider rollout targeted around thanksgiving much like version 12 which took a while to reach a full rollout version 13 a huge leap will be phased over time said nelsonthe panelists detailed several of new features included version 13 such as improved collision avoidance systems enhanced traffic control responses even ability to detect emergency vehicles through audio inputs one user actually showed that car could see an emergency vehicle coming moved to shoulder -- an impressive feature that speaks to depth of fsd system nelson saidthese advancements also include significant improvements ai architecture theyre scaling everything -- three times model size 42 times model context length five times training compute lutz explained its clear theyre throwing everything at improving fsd using much-expanded version of cortex this means bigger better more advanced models that will continue to improve performance of fsdchallenges of scheduling developmentdespite rapid pace of improvement there are inherent challenges to developing a technology as complex as teslas fsd this isnt like upgrading ios from version 16 to 17 lutz said were talking about entirely new capabilities that have never been done before so ability to schedule down to day becomes extremely difficult he emphasized that tesla making progress at an impressive pace especially when compared to previous versions of fsd theyre now converging on more predictable timelines delay has narrowed to about a 30-day window which pretty impressive given complexity lutz addeda global push expanding fsd beyond usanother topic of interest during panel was teslas expansion of fsd capabilities to international markets smart summon has now been released globally including europe china even though fsd supervision isnt yet fully approved these regions said ong this move he suggested signals teslas confidence that regulatory approvals are not far behind its easier to roll out these features other regions once you already have them functioning elsewhere nelson addedthe exponential path aheadthe panelists were unanimous their belief that teslas full self-driving system improving at an exponential rate theyre working through a punch list of engineering problems theyre getting it done said nelson continued upgrades hardware ai models sheer amount of data theyre processing means that fsd on an upward trajectory thats going to be very difficult for competitors to matchin near future teslas fsd system will be increasingly capable reliable ubiquitous as ong concluded even if there are delays teslas track record shows they will deliver these are engineering problems with solutions tesla one of few companies that have both technology ambition to solve themwith combined power of advanced ai robust data collection continued investment hardware teslas full self-driving poised to redefine whats possible autonomous driving -- not just us but globally road ahead may still have bumps but its clear that tesla accelerating at full speed toward a future where cars truly drive themselves,0.129626,positive

further said sam fiorani vice president of global vehicle forecasting at autoforecast solutions current capacity for evs higher than current level of demand removing any incentives to increase demand

sales for detroit three automakers challenge efforts to protect us autoworker jobs negotiations over tariffs trade with mexicomusk jumps on stage to speak alongside trump at a campaign event oct 5 butler pa (steven m falk/the philadelphia inquirer/tns)its a bromance which going to have major implications for detroit to beltway for tesla said daniel ives analyst for wealth management firm wedbush securities increpresentatives for tesla -- which holds nearly half of us ev market -- support killing plug-in vehicle subsidy according to reuters report although tesla benefits from tax credit too has three models that qualify credits are a greater advantage for other automakers by making their vehicles many of which arent profitable more affordable tesla has already achieved scale cost structure to produce evs profitablytesla has such a big cost advantage evs said david whiston an analyst at financial services firm morningstar inc getting rid of that tax credit wouldnt necessarily hurt themteslas lower-cost models source batteries from china which means they dont qualify for $7500 incentive unless vehicle leased inflation reduction act signed into law by president joe biden 2022 outlines sourcing requirements for plug-in vehicles their components to qualify for subsidy when purchasedforeign evs will be more competitive fiorani said they wont have local incentive to build them here unless another tariff put on korean- or german-built evschevrolet has five vehicles that qualify for $7500 cadillac has one chrysler has one ford has one two jeeps one ford one lincoln meet requirements for a $3750 tax creditproduction of ford f-150 lightning truck halted until new year as dearborn mich automaker seeks to preserve profitability as it projects a $5 billion loss from its model e ev unit for 2024 general motors co has said fourth quarter it expects its evs will be variable profit positive meaning they can start to cover cost of productionif tax credit disappears though automakers might have to make up difference fiorani said which would further delay profitabilitypaul zimmermann vice president dealership partner of matick automotive group with gm toyota stores metro detroit said group leases around 95% of evs it sells since federal tax credits make lease offers very appealing to customers with savings of $200 to $300 a monthso would it hurt ev sales yeah all of a sudden a $350 payment now $662 or $558 he said of losing incentivethe automakers recognize their future evs but its a bumpy road to get there as battery costs remain high charging infrastructure built out consumers become more educated on alternative powertrains fewer incentives could slow adoption further complicate plans for automakers investing billions of dollars into evs but losing tax credit may not be all bad news ives saidin eyes of street especially when it comes to gm thats bullish he said street wants to see them pull back on their ev initiatives thats wild jigsaw puzzle its a dog-ate-the-homework excuse to slow down ev strategy theory they wanted to slow things down but they already cemented their goals if tax credits get taken away they can shrug their shoulders its more profitable for them on iceford stellantis rivian declined to comment on potential tax credit elimination detroit news left a request for comment with a gm representativethe ev tax credit was established late 2008 at end of george w bush administration amid a deepening collapse of american auto industry biden administration with ira democratic presidents signature legislative achievement on fighting climate change reformed incentive including eliminating a cap that only tesla gm had hit at timetrump said he would nominate musk to lead a new department of government efficiency with vivek ramaswamy a pharmaceutical company entrepreneur who sought republican nomination for president department which would have to be created funded by congress charged with addressing countrys $65 trillion budget with mandate to dismantle government bureaucracy slash excess regulations cut wasteful expenditures restructure federal agencies by independence day 2026 according to a statement released from trumps transition teamthis will send shockwaves through system anyone involved government waste which a lot of people musk said a statementmany have questioned potential conflict of interest that could stem from musks involvement speculated that musks favor with president-elect could yield lucrative government contracts a favorable regulatory environment for tech moguls business ventures industries from telecommunications to space exploration but for teslas consumer auto business industry experts say impact will be mixedit may appear an odd partnership musk tesla have popularized evs while trump has decried government efforts to promote them criticizing increasing fuel economy carbon emission regulations as ev mandates saying he would get rid of incentives suggesting us automakers shouldnt worry about competing with chinese evsits a strategic poker bet for ages on trump said ives noting tesla ceo was on outs union labor-loyal biden administration they iced musk tesla out that would be like not inviting michael jordan to an nba hall of fame dinner it came back to bite them musk now goes from basically background to having a huge seat at tablecutting ev consumer tax credit wouldnt address pressure on automakers with respect to complying with aggressive federal fuel economy greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions regulations that were adopted under biden although those dont call for a specific kind of powertrain auto executives have said they cant meet those requirements without evs noncompliance would prevent a company from selling their vehicles heretrump has suggested rollbacks he could prevent ramp-up of biden requirements from model year 2027 to 2032 from taking effect try to revoke californias waiver to set its own rules that rulemaking process however can be more lengthythe us supreme courts decision this summer to overturn landmark 1984 decision chevron v natural resources defense council could create an easier path through courts chevron held if congress hasnt directly addressed question at center of a dispute a court had to uphold agencys interpretation of statute as long as it was reasonablethe last time congress set a fuel economy standard was energy independence security act of 2007 which called for a 35 mpg fuel economy standard for passenger cars light trucks by 2020 rules finalized by national highway traffic safety administration this year call for a corporate average fuel economy of 535 mpg by 2032trump has nominated former new york rep lee zeldin to lead environmental protection agency he has emphasized using epa to boost economic prosperity pursue energy independence musk himself a frequent critic of government regulations even as current structures carbon credit trading system supported profitability at teslabacking off one of biggest pressures on automakers to increase ev sales would mean less competition for tesla slashing of regulations certainly defends their position said mark wakefield global automotive market lead at management consultancy alixpartners llp it puts some distance between automakers trying to catch up to teslas cost structure scalethe company first became profitable 2020 partially thanks to sale of federal state-level credits accrued by only producing zero-emission evs tesla sold $16 billion credits that year according to a company filing to securities exchange commissionthose sales could decline or vanish altogether a more permissive regulatory environment with less need for credits but tesla no longer depends on credits to stay blackfor past decade tesla has made far more revenue from auto sales leases than from credits as company has reduced its costs to make each vehicle credit sales have played a smaller role driving profitsits a couple hundred million dollars wakefield said noting that tesla has best cost position of any ev maker country it helps but it doesnt mean business turns unprofitable (without them)kathy harris director of natural resource defense councils clean vehicles program suggested a federal reversal on evs would undercut companies that have tried to close that gapautomakers were actually there at event announcing adoption of new epa standards i think this really shows that automakers are on board she said theyre investing billions of dollars were seeing more of these investments come online us so its a really critical time to ensure that were continuing that positive drive forwardprofit positive for tesla on other hand could be what happens around autonomous driving creating a national standard would offer consistency over a patchwork of differing state regulations fifty states doing their own thing a nightmare for product planning whiston saidadditionally structural changes could pave way for technology to be launched more easily tesla offers its full self-driving semi-autonomous driving feature for $8000 or $99 per month last month company unveiled its artificial intelligence-equipped cybercab a wheel-less pedal-less robotaxi that wont launch until at least 2026thats game-changer ives said because autonomous fsd if that gets fast-tracked it unlocks a $1 trillion valuation related to ai that reason teslas stock has done what it has done when you look at transportation agencies musk has gone from hunted to hunter anything tesla did was caught up red tape a regulatory spiral now musk going to have a big say those same agencies that oversee himsome venture capitalists start-up founders see potential regulatory pullback as an action that could usher a golden age of innovation it however a cause for concern among consumer watchdogsdefect investigations dropped to all-time lows under first trump term said michael brooks executive director for center for auto safety its unlikely national highway traffic safety administration will be able to complete its collection analysis of information its investigation into tesla fsd issue a decision before trump inaugurated on jan 20 investigation followed four crashes including a fatal incident 2023their rulemaking enforcement research  all of that under threat particularly when you see musk cutting federal budget brooks said of nhtsa other transportation regulatory agencies there will be more dangerous vehicles on roadtrump has also emphasized tariffs as a way to promote domestic manufacturing has promised to renegotiate united states-mexico-canada trade agreement created under his previous termof particular concern chinese automakers like byd co opening a plant mexico importing product into united states tariff-free china-built evs which chinese government subsidizes face a 100% duty although domestic automotive executives have recognized their companies will have to compete with chinese internationally tariffs could serve as protection as us industry builds up its ev scale supply chainsbut for years mexicos lower-cost labor market has attracted auto assembly investment even from domestic manufacturers tesla this summer paused plans for a battery plant mexico until after election following trumps pledge to put a 100% tariff on vehicles built mexicomaybe elon can convince trump to lay off tariffs on at least parts within north america whiston said thatll be easier for everybodys supply chainsmost recently stellantis has said it will expand overflow production of ram 1500 to its plant saltillo mexico united auto workers has objected but detroit-based union that endorsed vice president kamala harris for presidency over trump unlikely to have much

further for tesla moreover this could affect japanese hybrid ev manufacturersit still a big question if pure evs will win game long run as noted at end of 2023 toyotas hybrid rollout has been widely

375,2024-11-20,how much of musks wealth comes from tax dollars government help,new york (cnn) -- elon musk worlds richest person partly due to his companies impressive innovations but his wealth also due to government contracts programs that affected his two main businesses - electric vehicles space travelnow president-elect donald trump has tasked tesla spacex ceo with eliminating waste from federal government new role musk will help direct policies on a wide range of issues government bodies including those that regulate his many business interestsfor example musk trump watched spacexs launch tuesday night of rocket that could someday take people back to moon even to mars amount us commits to those efforts will greatly affect spacexs financial successgovernment crucial to musks net worthits worthwhile to ask just how much of his world-leading net worth comes from government help over last 10 to 15 years answer not simpleby some measures little of his wealth thanks to taxpayers musk worth an estimated $326 billion according to bloombergs real-time billionaire tracker his companies have received only tens of billions from government contracts programsbut other ways virtually all of his net worth can be pinned to government help tesla spacex got started - survived their early days - with assistance from state federal policies government contracts loansthe foundation for musks financial success has been us government said daniel ives tech analyst for wedbush securitiesand value of tesla spacex doesnt come from their profits so farinstead their value comes from investments their future worth such as teslas publicly traded stock private funding rounds for spacexsince trumps election musks net worth has increased $64 billion or nearly 25% according to bloombergs estimate this partly based on assumption that future growth will be easier with musk offering advice on topics including artificial intelligence self-driving vehicles funding for agencies that have given his companies regulatory troubleteslas early survivaltesla has received relatively modest government contracts past but it got a lot of help getting started critical helpin january 2010 tesla was starting out had sold less than 2000 cars its history then company received a $465 million low-interest loan from department of energy months before its initial public offering with loan it developed its model s car its first major success paid back loan early through proceeds from an additional sale of stock 2013as tesla started to sell cars a $7500 tax credit for ev buyers allowed company other automakers to sell american-made evs at a higher price than market mightve allowed otherwisetesla buyers received federal tax credits worth an estimated $34 billion before perk disappeared entirely for tesla buyers at end of 2019 even if that only allowed tesla to raise prices by half that amount thats another $17 billion federal help when company was facing a cash crunchthe tax credit was restored 2023 as part of biden administrations inflation reduction act but musk has encouraged incoming trump administration to end $7500 tax credit which would seem to be against teslas interests but would be a blow for established automakers seeking to get a share of us ev market those legacy automakers would have to accept bigger losses on their ev sales or pull back on offerings which would reduce competition for teslatake away subsidies it will only help tesla musk posted on his social media platform x julyfinancial windfall from ev regulationsbut teslas most significant financial support not from tax credits for ev buyers it comes from sale of regulatory credits that other automakers buy to comply with state federal regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gasesthe money doesnt come from taxpayers but without government regulation there would be no billions flowing into teslas coffers straight to its billion linesthose credit sales literally kept teslas lights on its paychecks being cashed companys early days they accounted for nearly 25% of its revenue 2008 10% of its revenue over course of next five yearsbetween 2008 2019 sales of regulatory credits generated more than $2 billion for companytesla might have died without those funds dont take our word for it ask musk himselfin a tweet 2020 musk admitted that tesla was nearly forced to file for bankruptcy as recently at 2019 stock price had been floundering as company had difficulty ramping up production of its model 3 sedanclosest we got (to bankruptcy) was about a month he said tweet model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time -- from mid 2017 to mid 2019 production & logistics helleven when threat of bankruptcy lessened it wasnt until 2021 that company was able to post a profit without help of credit salesin teslas history sales of regulatory credits have brought nearly $11 billion with all of it falling pretty much directly to its bottom lineif it didnt have regulatory credits tesla would not be brand it around globe musk wouldnt be richest person world said ives who a bull on tesla shares today 2019 he was still skepticalspacexs value depends on nasaeven without his shares options tesla musk would still likely be worth more than $100 billion one of richest people on planet spacex will likely be valued at about $250 billion an upcoming round of funding from investors reuters said ives said while spacex has not disclosed musks holdings his estimate close to 50%taxpayer support for spacex comes from direct government contracts that are worth billionsaccording to usaspendinggov government database that tracks federal spending spacex has signed contracts worth nearly $20 billion most crucial one came just before christmas 2008 when spacex musk were both virtually out of cashthat contract was worth $16 billion involved flying 12 supply missions to international space station deal allowed spacex to complete falcon 9 rocket its main workhorse dragon capsule said casey dreier senior space policy advisory for planetary society a public interest group advocating space flightthey were right on edge of insolvency dreier said elon has pointed out at that moment they were on edge that helped to save companydreier said iss deal other contracts have allowed nasa to transport us astronauts without relying on russiaspacex has since gotten numerous additional contracts from nasa military other us government agencies it won a $3 billion contract to develop next vehicle to carry astronauts to moon dreier said company other nasa contractors benefit from access to agencys employees expertiseives said that if trump administration increases funding for nasas efforts to return to moon travel to mars spacexs value could

378,2024-11-20,tras años con el viento a favor tesla afronta en 2024 una cruda realidad un curso de no crecimiento,tesla vive en una montaña rusa de emociones al tiempo que busca su propio rumbo elon musk quiere convertir la compaña en una empresa de tecnologa e inteligencia artificial los inversores parecen reclamar un elctrico de tesla asequible y las ventas a nivel mundial se aproximan a su primera cada en la historia de la compañaun crecimiento meterico en 2016 tesla puso en el mercado 76900 automviles cuatro años depsus en 2020 tesla se qued a las puertas de vender medio milln de unidades a nivel mundial en 2024 coloc 18 millones de unidades son datos recogidos por statistaentre medias ni un solo año tesla ha vendido menos que el año anterior de hecho su crecimiento ha sido sorprendente con especial relevancia en el salto de 2020 a 2021 cuando casi doblaron la produccin era de esperar por tanto que en 2024 se rompiera la barrera de las dos millones de unidades sin embargo los datos indican que esto no ser­ asque ahora se frena hace unas semanas reuters aseguraba que elon musk estaba prometiendo crecimientos de ventas de un 30% en 2025 una cifra que consideran muy difcil de cumplir ya que para este 2024 auguraban un nuevo rcord en la cifra de ventas anuales superando por muy poco los 18 millones de vehculossin embargo los nuevos reportes que van llegando parecen alejar esta cifra las ventas en china de la compaña quedaron en 40485 unidades el pasado mes de octubre seg§n @troyteslike especialista en monitorizar las ventas de la compaña seg§n sus datos tesla necesita unas ventas espectaculares en estados unidos y china en los prximos meses y eso no parece que vaya a ocurrirun sntoma tesla vendi en octubre casi 6000 unidades menos de vehculos en china que en el pasado mes de julio la comparacin no tiene sentido con agosto y septiembre (en esos meses colocaron 63456 y 72200 unidades respectivamente) porque el primer mes de cada trimestre siempre suele ser muy flojo para la compañasin embargo s nos da una idea de por dnde van los tiros tesla necesita poner en el mercado 514925 vendidos en este trimestre es todo un desafo ya que aunque las ventas no se resienten del todo en china s lo est­n haciendo sensiblemente en europa y estados unidosrestados unidos aunque en china las ventas parecen encontrarse all donde se esperan en estados unidos est­n cayendo conforme el año ha ido avanzando las ventas poco a poco han ido disminuyendo abril mayo y junio fue un trimestre especialmente malo pero tampoco consiguieron superar las ventas de 2023 en julio pero lo m­s problem­tico fue septiembre cuando m­s entregas se esperan de la compaña y se perdieron casi 6000 unidades respecto a septiembre del año pasadolos analistas achacan esta cada en las ventas en estados unidos a una cada en las ventas del tesla model y el futuro a corto plazo para la empresa es algo incierto en el pas la implicacin de elon musk en el nuevo gobierno de donald trump ha espantado a los clientes en california su mejor mercado y est­ por ver cmo reaccionan los compradores si se eliminan las ayudas a la compra de coches elctricos como ha prometido el futuro presidente estadounidenseen bloomberg no tienen claro cmo puede afectar a la compaña la eliminacin de estas ayudas elon musk parece estar tan convencido de su posicin dominante en estados unidos que cree que esta decisin puede hacer mucho daño a los rivales y muy poco a su compaña en el mercado del coche elctrico en estados unidos la fuerza de tesla ha sido tan evidente hasta ahora que sus rivales han acabado ofreciendo el est­ndar de carga de compaña porque sus clientes quieren poder acceder a la red de tesla dados los pocos enchufes en el paseuropa tampoco en europa las cosas pintan demasiado bien hasta septiembre §ltimo trimestre completo y §ltimo mes de los que acea tiene datos tesla ha vendido 249337 coches elctricos por los 273197 del año pasado en el mismo periodo es una cada del 87%esta cada se entiende con la retirada de ayudas a la compra en alemania con datos de este verano la cada era del 447% y mes a mes en algunos casos superaban el 60% tesla no es la §nica que cae con fuerza en el pas germano pero el mayor mercado europeo es clave para que la compaña siga creciendo en europa tambin en francia el segundo mayor mercado de elctricos en europa tesla se ha dejado ventas del model y su coche m­s vendido¨por qu los motivos por los que tesla se est­ dejando ventas en 2024 son m§ltiples en europa es evidente que las ayudas a la compra del coche elctrico son claves para seguir manteniendo con vida sus ventas en china la competencia es cada vez m­s fuerte y el p§blico hace tiempo que prefiere los fabricantes locales con interiores altamente tecnolgicos que los modelos extranjeros lo que parece estar frenando el avance de tesla en el pasen estados unidos queda por ver hasta qu punto el posicionamiento poltico de elon musk puede tener su influencia en las ventas de la compaña tambin cmo responder­ el cliente ante una posible retirada de las ayudas a la compra no son pocos los propietarios de tesla que dejan claro su rechazo a los §ltimos movimientos de musk con pegatinas en el cochepero a todo lo anterior hay que sumar una renovacin del tesla model y muy esperada que no termina de llegar el modelo m­s vendido de la compaña parece estar a las puertas de una renovacin que ira m­s all­ de lo esttico y que debera reimpulsar las ventas el prximo año esto podra estar frenando a los potenciales clientes¨a qu retos se enfrenta tesla tesla tiene en el corto plazo grandes retos por delante como decimos en china hay poco espacio para el crecimiento con una competencia tan feroz en estados unidos tampoco se espera un crecimiento aunque la retirada en las ayudas dañe m­s a los rivales que a tesla sus ventas pueden resentirse aunque es probable que en menor medida que en mercados como alemania o franciay en europa la competencia ser­ mucho m­s dura el prximo año la nueva normativa de emisiones que entra en vigor en 2025 debera rebajar los precios de los coches elctricos los fabricantes tendr­n que vender m­s vehculos de este tipo o en el peor de los casos automatricularlos y dar salida poco a poco a un stock que se vender­ a precios m­s competitivos por lo que la competencia ser­ m­s dura¨cu­les son sus fortalezas en primer lugar tesla cuenta con la garanta de que parte con ventaja en el coche elctrico si sus rivales sufren en sus cuentas de resultados en estados unidos les ser­ m­s complicado ponerse a la altura de la empresa de elon musken europa adem­s se le abre la puerta de la venta de bonos de emisiones que ser­n claves el prximo año de nuevo tesla se encuentra en una posicin parecida tendr­ m­s competencia pero es probable que sus propios rivales acaben aportando un extra a su cuenta bancaria lo que ayuda a paliar el freno de las ventasy adem­s habr­ que ver si su cercana a elon musk le permite que el gobierno de

380,2024-11-19,tras años con el viento a favor tesla afronta en 2024 una cruda realidad un curso de no crecimiento,tesla vive en una montaña rusa de emociones al tiempo que busca su propio rumbo elon musk quiere convertir la compaña en una empresa de tecnologa e inteligencia artificial los inversores parecen reclamar un elctrico de tesla asequible y las ventas a nivel mundial se aproximan a su primera cada en la historia de la compañaun crecimiento meterico en 2016 tesla puso en el mercado 76900 automviles cuatro años depsus en 2020 tesla se qued a las puertas de vender medio milln de unidades a nivel mundial en 2024 coloc 18 millones de unidades son datos recogidos por statistaentre medias ni un solo año tesla ha vendido menos que el año anterior de hecho su crecimiento ha sido sorprendente con especial relevancia en el salto de 2020 a 2021 cuando casi doblaron la produccin era de esperar por tanto que en 2024 se rompiera la barrera de las dos millones de unidades sin embargo los datos indican que esto no ser­ asque ahora se frena hace unas semanas reuters aseguraba que elon musk estaba prometiendo crecimientos de ventas de un 30% en 2025 una cifra que consideran muy difcil de cumplir ya que para este 2024 auguraban un nuevo rcord en la cifra de ventas anuales superando por muy poco los 18 millones de vehculossin embargo los nuevos reportes que van llegando parecen alejar esta cifra las ventas en china de la compaña quedaron en 40485 unidades el pasado mes de octubre seg§n @troyteslike especialista en monitorizar las ventas de la compaña seg§n sus datos tesla necesita unas ventas espectaculares en estados unidos y china en los prximos meses y eso no parece que vaya a ocurrirun sntoma tesla vendi en octubre casi 6000 unidades menos de vehculos en china que en el pasado mes de julio la comparacin no tiene sentido con agosto y septiembre (en esos meses colocaron 63456 y 72200 unidades respectivamente) porque el primer mes de cada trimestre siempre suele ser muy flojo para la compañasin embargo s nos da una idea de por dnde van los tiros tesla necesita poner en el mercado 514925 vendidos en este trimestre es todo un desafo ya que aunque las ventas no se resienten del todo en china s lo est­n haciendo sensiblemente en europa y estados unidosestados unidos aunque en china las ventas parecen encontrarse all donde se esperan en estados unidos est­n cayendo conforme el año ha ido avanzando las ventas poco a poco han ido disminuyendo abril mayo y junio fue un trimestre especialmente malo pero tampoco consiguieron superar las ventas de 2023 en julio pero lo m­s problem­tico fue septiembre cuando m­s entregas se esperan de la compaña y se perdieron casi 6000 unidades respecto a septiembre del año pasadolos analistas achacan esta cada en las ventas en estados unidos a una cada en las ventas del tesla model y el futuro a corto plazo para la empresa es algo incierto en el pas la implicacin de elon musk en el nuevo gobierno de donald trump ha espantado a los clientes en california su mejor mercado y est­ por ver cmo reaccionan los compradores si se eliminan las ayudas a la compra de coches elctricos como ha prometido el futuro presidente estadounidenseen bloomberg no tienen claro cmo puede afectar a la compaña la eliminacin de estas ayudas elon musk parece estar tan convencido de su posicin dominante en estados unidos que cree que esta decisin puede hacer mucho daño a los rivales y muy poco a su compaña en el mercado del coche elctrico en estados unidos la fuerza de tesla ha sido tan evidente hasta ahora que sus rivales han acabado ofreciendo el est­ndar de carga de compaña porque sus clientes quieren poder acceder a la red de tesla dados los pocos enchufes en el paseuropa tampoco en europa las cosas pintan demasiado bien hasta septiembre §ltimo trimestre completo y §ltimo mes de los que acea tiene datos tesla ha vendido 249337 coches elctricos por los 273197 del año pasado en el mismo periodo es una cada del 87%esta cada se entiende con la retirada de ayudas a la compra en alemania con datos de este verano la cada era del 447% y mes a mes en algunos casos superaban el 60% tesla no es la §nica que cae con fuerza en el pas germano pero el mayor mercado europeo es clave para que la compaña siga creciendo en europa tambin en francia el segundo mayor mercado de elctricos en europa tesla se ha dejado ventas del model y su coche m­s vendido¨por qu los motivos por los que tesla se est­ dejando ventas en 2024 son m§ltiples en europa es evidente que las ayudas a la compra del coche elctrico son claves para seguir manteniendo con vida sus ventas en china la competencia es cada vez m­s fuerte y el p§blico hace tiempo que prefiere los fabricantes locales con interiores altamente tecnolgicos que los modelos extranjeros lo que parece estar frenando el avance de tesla en el pasen estados unidos queda por ver hasta qu punto el posicionamiento poltico de elon musk puede tener su influencia en las ventas de la compaña tambin cmo responder­ el cliente ante una posible retirada de las ayudas a la compra no son pocos los propietarios de tesla que dejan claro su rechazo a los §ltimos movimientos de musk con pegatinas en el cochepero a todo lo anterior hay que sumar una renovacin del tesla model y muy esperada que no termina de llegar el modelo m­s vendido de la compaña parece estar a las puertas de una renovacin que ira m­s all­ de lo esttico y que debera reimpulsar las ventas el prximo año esto podra estar frenando a los potenciales clientes¨a qu retos se enfrenta tesla tesla tiene en el corto plazo grandes retos por delante como decimos en china hay poco espacio para el crecimiento con una competencia tan feroz en estados unidos tampoco se espera un crecimiento aunque la retirada en las ayudas dañe m­s a los rivales que a tesla sus ventas pueden resentirse aunque es probable que en menor medida que en mercados como alemania o franciay en europa la competencia ser­ mucho m­s dura el prximo año la nueva normativa de emisiones que entra en vigor en 2025 debera rebajar los precios de los coches elctricos los fabricantes tendr­n que vender m­s vehculos de este tipo o en el peor de los casos automatricularlos y dar salida poco a poco a un stock que se vender­ a precios m­s competitivos por lo que la competencia ser­ m­s dura¨cu­les son sus fortalezas en primer lugar tesla cuenta con la garanta de que parte con ventaja en el coche elctrico si sus rivales sufren en sus cuentas de resultados en estados unidos les ser­ m­s complicado ponerse a la altura de la empresa de elon musken europa adem­s se le abre la puerta de la venta de bonos de emisiones que ser­n claves el prximo año de nuevo tesla se encuentra en una posicin parecida tendr­ m­s competencia pero es probable que sus propios rivales acaben aportando un extra a su cuenta bancaria lo que ayuda a paliar el freno de las ventasy adem­s habr­ que ver si su cercana a elon musk le permite que el gobierno de estados unidos abra la mano con los coches autnomos esto es clave para sacar m­s dinero con el software y sobre todo avanzar con un robotaxi prometido para 2026 y que por la propia regulacin

383,2024-11-18,why elon musk really embracing donald trump,on wednesday during a gathering at mar-a-lago attended by some of donald trumps closest associates a speaker demanded where george soros of right a scene that an attendee captured on video elon musk fifty-three-year-old south african-born billionaire who reportedly spent about a hundred thirty million dollars to aid trumps campaign support other republicans competitive races raised his arm amid loud cheers speaker declared god bless you elon we are so so gratefulmusk has claimed publicly that he has never asked trump for any favors that trump has not offered him any despite spreading misinformation on x his social-media platform heavily financing campaign of someone who plotted an autogolpe he has also denied being a political extremist after mar-a-lago video surfaced musk wrote on x that he was  george soros of middle other words he has portrayed himself as someone who entered political arena to make world a better placeon wall street there a more self-serving explanation for musks bear hug of trump its a poker move for ages dan ives an analyst at wedbush securities who has long been bullish on teslas stock told cnbc if thats true play has already paid off big time between trumps victory on november 5th close of trading on friday teslas stock price went from $25150 to $32072 according to teslas filings with securities exchange commission musk owns about 715 million shares so based on that figure value of his stake has risen by almost fifty billion dollars this vast sum dwarfs millions he spent on trumps behalf even forty-four billion dollars that he a group of investors paid for twitter 2022 an acquisition that greatly increased his ability to influence political process soros during his career as a wall street speculator had some big scores but none of them were anywhere near as monumental as musks post-election gainsthe run-up teslas stock reflects investors conviction that policies of a second trump administration will be favorable to carmaker but presence of trump white house could also have important implications for musks other companies many of which are subject to oversight by federal agencies such as federal trade commission federal communications commission or which have big contracts with government departmentsfor example spacex musks innovative rocket company has received nearly twenty billion dollars federal contracts since 2008 it now a major provider of launches to international space station 2022 it surpassed boeing as nasas second most utilized contractor spacex already stands to receive billions more coming years but a new nasa mission to mars say could open federal spigot even wider trump hasnt said much about that idea publicly but musk posted a couple of weeks ago vote for @realdonaldtrump if you want humanity to make it to marstrumps determination to build up us space force that he created 2019 could send more federal dollars direction of spacex october space force awarded a $7336 million contract to musks company for space launches if trump expands its budget more contracts could well result elsewhere musks satellite company starlink which came to public attention for its role providing internet service ukraine after russias invasion may also stand to benefit from election during first trump administration federal communications commission provisionally awarded starlink nearly nine hundred million dollars under a program to deliver broadband to rural areas but last december agency cancelled funding on grounds that company had failed to meet programs requirements now some republicans want to restore ittesla big kahuna however on thursday its stock sank on reports that trump transition team planning to eliminate seventy-five-hundred-dollar federal tax credit for ev buyers that biden administration expanded as part of its green-industrial policy if this cancellation stalls further adoption of evs it would seem likely to hurt tesla -- but outlook isnt so clear since joe biden came to office legacy automakers like ford general motors have invested heavily new evs ev plants but so far they havent made a huge dent teslas market share which still hovering at around fifty per cent musk now seems to be betting that eliminating credits would prompt other automakers to cut back their expansion plans for ev market or even abandon them entirely which would reinforce teslas dominant position i think it would be devastating for our competitors for tesla slightly he said during a july earnings call but long term probably actually helps tesla would be my guess on thursday musk responded to news that trump was indeed moving toward eliminating tax credits my view we should end all government subsidies including those for evs oil gas he wrote on xlooking ahead musk has made clear that he believes teslas future hinges on its autonomous driving system known as autopilot which it has been investing heavily for years pressing regulators to approve for a rollout last year musk said that teslas high stock-market valuation was primarily on basis of autonomy but his plan to turn tesla into a producer of driverless vehicles has run into obstacles day-to-day regulation of motor vehicles takes place at state level tesla which was long based california has been making slow progress with lawmakers sacramento moreover national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) has found that teslas driver-assisted version of autopilot contributed to hundreds of crashes more than a dozen fatalities agency now evaluating effectiveness of a software update that tesla issued last decemberdespite ongoing federal investigation during a tesla earnings call october musk called for a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles which would dispense with lengthy state-by-state applications he didnt explain why such a system would work better for tesla but given that trumps re®lection was offing perhaps no explanation was really needed there will be a knock on door for nhtsa its musk ives tesla-stock bull said ives predicted that switching to a federal system of regulation could speed up approval of driverless cars by at least two or three years this what stock starting to reflect he addedin another apparent paradox trumps proposals to impose tariffs of up to sixty per cent on imports from china where tesla has its biggest factory could also end up helping carmaker new tariffs would reinforce barriers that keep out cheap chinese evs which i wrote about earlier this year which potentially represent an existential threat to all american carmakers tesla included on other hand tariffs could raise teslas own costs although tesla doesnt import vehicles it makes china to united states it does import some of components of its american-made cars their prices could rise sharply -- unless of course second trump administration granted it same sort of carve-out from new tariffs that first trump administration granted to apple after a personal appeal by its ceo tim cook trump likely to grant musk such an invaluable favor we have to

393,2024-11-20,how much of musks wealth comes from tax dollars government help,new york (cnn) -- elon musk worlds richest person partly due to his companies impressive innovations but his wealth also due to government contracts programs that affected his two main businesses - electric vehicles space travelnow president-elect donald trump has tasked tesla spacex ceo with eliminating waste from federal government new role musk will help direct policies on a wide range of issues government bodies including those that regulate his many business interestsfor example musk trump watched spacexs launch tuesday night of rocket that could someday take people back to moon even to mars amount us commits to those efforts will greatly affect spacexs financial successgovernment crucial to musks net worthits worthwhile to ask just how much of his world-leading net worth comes from government help over last 10 to 15 years answer not simpleby some measures little of his wealth thanks to taxpayers musk worth an estimated $326 billion according to bloombergs real-time billionaire tracker his companies have received only tens of billions from government contracts programsbut other ways virtually all of his net worth can be pinned to government help tesla spacex got started - survived their early days - with assistance from state federal policies government contracts loansthe foundation for musks financial success has been us government said daniel ives tech analyst for wedbush securitiesand value of tesla spacex doesnt come from their profits so farinstead their value comes from investments their future worth such as teslas publicly traded stock private funding rounds for spacexsince trumps election musks net worth has increased $64 billion or nearly 25% according to bloombergs estimate this partly based on assumption that future growth will be easier with musk offering advice on topics including artificial intelligence self-driving vehicles funding for agencies that have given his companies regulatory troubleteslas early survivaltesla has received relatively modest government contracts past but it got a lot of help getting started critical helpin january 2010 tesla was starting out had sold less than 2000 cars its history then company received a $465 million low-interest loan from department of energy months before its initial public offering with loan it developed its model s car its first major success paid back loan early through proceeds from an additional sale of stock 2013as tesla started to sell cars a $7500 tax credit for ev buyers allowed company other automakers to sell american-made evs at a higher price than market mightve allowed otherwisetesla buyers received federal tax credits worth an estimated $34 billion before perk disappeared entirely for tesla buyers at end of 2019 even if that only allowed tesla to raise prices by half that amount thats another $17 billion federal help when company was facing a cash crunchthe tax credit was restored 2023 as part of biden administrations inflation reduction act but musk has encouraged incoming trump administration to end $7500 tax credit which would seem to be against teslas interests but would be a blow for established automakers seeking to get a share of us ev market those legacy automakers would have to accept bigger losses on their ev sales or pull back on offerings which would reduce competition for teslabut teslas most significant financial support not from tax credits for ev buyers it comes from sale of regulatory credits that other automakers buy to comply with state federal regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gasesthe money doesnt come from taxpayers but without government regulation there would be no billions flowing into teslas coffers straight to its billion linesthose credit sales literally kept teslas lights on its paychecks being cashed companys early days they accounted for nearly 25% of its revenue 2008 10% of its revenue over

los mandatos y subsidios para los vehculos elctricos luego lleg agosto cuando musk respald a trump y comenz a invertir millones de dlares en la campaña de trump no mucho despus trump dijo que ahora estaba a favor de cierta participacin de mercado para los vehculos elctricostengo que serlo ya sabes porque elon me apoy firmemente dijo trump en una manifestacin en atlanta¨qu significa la administracin trump para el futuro de los vehculos elctricoslos defensores del transporte limpio tienen la esperanza de que musk siga influyendo en la posicin de trump sobre los vehculos elctricossi hay un lado positivo en la victoria de trump dijo ramses madou presidente de la open mobility foundation es que elon musk puede reducir el anti-ev de trumpstos son algunos de los problemas que enfrentan los partidarios de los automviles y camiones elctricos y cmo musk podra influir en ellosincentivos al compradorreuters y otras organizaciones de noticias informaron el viernes que trump planea terminar el crdito fiscal al consumidor de 7500 dlares para vehculos elctricos una medida que musk apoyadespus de construir su empresa gracias a incentivos para compradores financiados con fondos federales musk cree que tesla ya no los necesita y que eliminar los subsidios perjudicar­ principalmente a sus competidoresquiten los subsidios escribi musk en x en julio slo ayudar­ a tesla¨por qu una empresa rechazara ese dinero gratis porque tesla es rentable y el negocio de vehculos elctricos de los fabricantes de automviles tradicionales todava no lo es quitarles los crditos a los compradores les perjudicara m­s que a tesla cuya cuota de mercado de vehculos elctricos ha comenzado a caer ante la nueva competenciapero hay m­s en la historia este año tesla ha registrado ganancias de 4790 millones de dlares de esa cifra 2070 millones de dlares provinieron de crditos requeridos por el gobierno comprado a tesla por otros fabricantes de automviles eso es el 43% de los ingresos netosel sistema federal de crdito para vehculos elctricos tiene un concepto simple vende demasiados automviles a gasolina y acumula dficits si la mayora de los vehculos que vende son vehculos elctricos obtendr­ crditos para evitar sanciones gubernamentales los poseedores de dficit deben comprar crditos de empresas como teslaen otras palabras los competidores de tesla est­n aumentando directa y dram­ticamente las ganancias de tesla con ricos flujos de efectivo que de otro modo podran haber utilizado en su propio desarrollo de vehculos elctricos¨cmo encajan los incentivos para los compradores de vehculos elctricos y por qu podra musk querer que desaparezcan cuantos menos vehculos elctricos vendan otros fabricantes de automviles m­s dinero crediticio recibir­ tesla como pura ganancia lo que impulsar­ el precio de sus propias acciones y ejercer­ presin sobre las acciones de sus competidores desde las elecciones las acciones de tesla han subido un 28% y cerraron a 32072 dlares el viernes la mayora de las acciones de los dem­s fabricantes de automviles est­n estancadas en neutralsubvenciones federalestesla no slo fabrica vehculos de pasajeros sino tambin camiones comerciales al menos lo est­ intentando con gran fanfarria musk present el gran camin tesla semi totalmente elctrico en 2017 hasta la fecha la compaña ha vendido muy pocos planea comenzar la produccin en masa en 2026 mientras tanto los fabricantes de camiones tradicionales est­n vendiendo sus propios camiones elctricos grandes y no pueden satisfacer la demandala demanda es alta debido a los mandatos gubernamentales en california endulzados con generosas subvenciones estatales y federales por valor de miles de millones pocos compraran hoy un camin elctrico sin la ayuda del gobierno un camin disel nuevo suele costar entre 150000 y 200000 dlares una versin totalmente elctrica cuesta entre dos y tres veces esa cantidadcortar esas subvenciones federales podra ayudar a tesla a luchar contra la competencia perjudicara a los principales fabricantes de camiones y podra destruir a las nuevas empresas de camiones elctricos al tiempo que le dara tiempo al tesla semi retrasado durante mucho tiempo para ponerse al dael dinero de la subvencin federal tambin est­ disponible para los compradores de camiones con pila de combustible de hidrgeno musk ha menospreciado durante mucho tiempo los vehculos de pila de combustible y trump ha hablado a menudo de que los coches de hidrgeno explotan como una bomba atmica esto es una gran exageracin ya que los vehculos de gasolina de batera y de hidrgeno est­n sujetos a incendios y explosiones aunque de diferentes maneras no obstante si trump le pregunta a musk su opinin sobre dejar de apoyar los vehculos de hidrgeno musk seguramente lo incitar­aranceleslas conversaciones de musk con trump sobre los aranceles podran ser complicadas tesla dirige una enorme planta de ensamblaje en shanghai sujeta al control del gobierno chino aunque muestra poca autorregulacin al lanzar ataques feroces contra polticos que no le agradan musk slo tiene palabras amables para los lderes chinos incluido el presidente xi jinpinga principios de este año musk pareci apoyar las barreras comerciales contra una posible afluencia de vehculos elctricos chinos a estados unidos diciendo que las empresas chinas podran demoler a otros fabricantes de vehculos elctricos en todo el mundo sin embargo al cabo de unos meses cambi su tonooponindose a los aranceles sobre los vehculos elctricos porque las cosas que inhiben la libertad de intercambio o distorsionan el mercado no son buenasuno de los principales pilares de la poltica econmica de trump son los hermosos aranceles del 60% o m­s sobre los productos chinos lderes empresariales economistas e incluso miembros de su propio partido han advertido que una poltica de este tipo podra impulsar la inflacin y perjudicar el crecimiento econmicomuchos de los bienes que estados unidos importa son bienes intermedios utilizados en la produccin de otras cosas elevando as los costos en todos los ­mbitos de los productos fabricados en estados unidos y provocando autolesiones en toda la economa dijo jonathan humphrey economista senior de benchmark mineral intelligence  se refiere principalmente a todos los productos intermedios que se utilizan para fabricar automviles bateras y sus componentes incluso para productos fabricados en estados unidostrump est­ recibiendo asesoramiento de todas las partes sobre el asunto y a§n est­ por verse si las decisiones sobre aranceles siguen el camino de musk (o el de xi)cargandomusk no habla mucho sobre la financiacin federal para las estaciones p§blicas de carga de vehculos elctricos pero es difcil ver por qu luchara contra elloel proyecto de ley bipartidista de infraestructura de biden dedic 5 mil millones de dlares a construir estaciones p§blicas de carga para automviles y camiones cada 50 millas a lo largo de las carreteras interestatales tesla ha construido una red amplia y confiable de estaciones de carga y ahora est­ invitando a los propietarios de vehculos elctricos que no son de tesla a pagarle a tesla para usarlos pero m­s estaciones de vehculos elctricos en m­s lugares facilitar­n las cosas a los propietarios de vehculos tesla y aliviar­n la necesidad de tesla gastar­ capital en construir m­s de elloses poco probable que trump elimine un programa que producir­ beneficios econmicos en todo el pas en los distritos electorales rojos y azules en cualquier caso el dinero ya est­ asignado y se necesitara una ley del congreso para cambiar eso dijo debs schrimmer de la oficina conjunta de energa y transporte de estados unidos en la conferencia de movilidad comotion la en little tokyo la semana pasadacertezanunca se

421,2024-11-20,how much of musks wealth comes from tax dollars government help,new york (cnn) -- elon musk worlds richest person partly due to his companies impressive innovations but his wealth also due to government contracts programs that affected his two main businesses - electric vehicles space travelnow president-elect donald trump has tasked tesla spacex ceo with eliminating waste from federal government new role musk will help direct policies on a wide range of issues government bodies including those that regulate his many business interestsfor example musk trump watched spacexs launch tuesday night of rocket that could someday take people back to moon even to mars amount us commits to those efforts will greatly affect spacexs financial successits worthwhile to ask just how much of his world-leading net worth comes from government help over last 10 to 15 years answer not simpleby some measures little of his wealth thanks to taxpayers musk worth an estimated $326 billion according to bloombergs real-time billionaire tracker his companies have received only tens of billions from government contracts programsbut other ways virtually all of his net worth can be pinned to government help tesla spacex got started - survived their early days - with assistance from state federal policies government contracts loansthe foundation for musks financial success has been us government said daniel ives tech analyst for wedbush securitiesand value of tesla spacex doesnt come from their profits so farinstead their value comes from investments their future worth such as teslas publicly traded stock private funding rounds for spacexsince trumps election musks net worth has increased $64 billion or nearly 25% according to bloombergs estimate this partly based on assumption that future growth will be easier with musk offering advice on topics including artificial intelligence self-driving vehicles funding for agencies that have given his companies regulatory troubletesla has received relatively modest government contracts past but it got a lot of help getting started critical helpin january 2010 tesla was starting out had sold less than 2000 cars its history then company received a $465 million low-interest loan from department of energy months before its initial public offering with loan it developed its model s car its first major success paid back loan early through proceeds from an additional sale of stock 2013as tesla started to sell cars a $7500 tax credit for ev buyers allowed company other automakers to sell american-made evs at a higher price than market mightve allowed otherwisetesla buyers received federal tax credits worth an estimated $34 billion before perk disappeared entirely for tesla buyers at end of 2019 even if that only allowed tesla to raise prices by half that amount thats another $17 billion federal help when company was facing a cash crunchthe tax credit was restored 2023 as part of biden administrations inflation reduction act but musk has encouraged incoming trump administration to end $7500 tax credit which would seem to be against teslas interests but would be a blow for established automakers seeking to get a share of us ev market those legacy automakers would have to accept bigger losses on their ev sales or pull back on offerings which would reduce competition for teslabut teslas most significant financial support not from tax credits for ev buyers it comes from sale of regulatory credits that other automakers buy to comply with state federal regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gasesthe money doesnt come from taxpayers but without government regulation there would be no billions flowing into teslas coffers straight to its billion linesthose credit sales literally kept teslas lights on its paychecks being cashed companys early days they accounted for nearly 25% of its revenue 2008 10% of its revenue over course of next five yearsbetween 2008 2019 sales of regulatory credits generated more than $2 billion for companytesla might have died without those funds dont take our word for it ask musk himselfin a tweet 2020 musk admitted that tesla was nearly forced to file for bankruptcy as recently at 2019 stock price had been floundering as company had difficulty ramping up production of its model 3 sedanclosest we got (to bankruptcy) was about a month he said tweet model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time -- from mid 2017 to mid 2019 production & logistics helleven when threat of bankruptcy lessened it wasnt until 2021 that company was able to post a profit without help of credit salesin teslas history sales of regulatory credits have brought nearly $11 billion with all of it falling pretty much directly to its bottom lineif it didnt have regulatory credits tesla would not be brand it around globe musk wouldnt be richest person world said ives who a bull on tesla shares today 2019 he was still skepticaleven without his shares options tesla musk would still likely be worth more than $100 billion one of richest people on planet spacex will likely be valued at about $250 billion an upcoming round of funding from investors reuters said ives said while spacex has not disclosed musks holdings his estimate close to 50%taxpayer support for spacex comes from direct government contracts that are worth billionsaccording to usaspendinggov government database that tracks federal spending spacex has signed contracts worth nearly $20 billion most crucial one came just before christmas 2008 when spacex musk were both virtually out of cashthat contract was worth $16 billion involved flying 12 supply missions to international space station deal allowed spacex to complete falcon 9 rocket its main workhorse dragon capsule said casey dreier senior space policy advisory for planetary society a public interest group advocating space flightthey were right on edge of insolvency dreier said elon has pointed out at that moment they were on edge that helped to save companydreier said iss deal other contracts have allowed nasa to transport us astronauts without relying on russiaspacex has since gotten numerous additional contracts from nasa military other us government agencies it won a $3 billion contract to develop next vehicle to carry astronauts to moon dreier said company other nasa contractors benefit from access to agencys employees expertiseives said that if trump administration increases funding for nasas efforts to return to moon travel to mars spacexs value could easily

425,2024-11-18,tesla inc aktuelle entwicklungen und perspektiven des pioniers der elektromobilitt,tesla ceo laughs at competitionby daniel miller | more articlesaugust 9 2013 | comments (7)teslas model s photo credit tesla media gallerytesla (nasdaq tsla ) a rare company a rare investing opportunity its truly disrupting an automotive industry which continues to sell nearly all its vehicles with internal combustion engines its model s has a personality fused between a sports car a luxury model truly a step above anything else ev market - maybe a few steps ahead fact teslas model s scored 99 out of a 100 when consumer reports tested it - a special feat to be sure so whats one thing that could bring tesla down from its high horse hint it has something to do with ceo elon musk laughing out loud at competition recentlyreason for optimismbefore we get to one thing that could drop tesla down a notch or two lets cover why red-hot company which up nearly 300% year to date has reason to gloat wall street many analysts focus much of their attention on short term on whether a company beat or missed eps thats first reason for teslas optimismearlier this week tesla announced that on a non-gaap basis it earned $100 million gross profit thats good for a gross margin of 22% or 13% without one-time zero-emission vehicle or zev credits - still a ways from its 25% gross margin goal fourth quarter on that non-gaap basis its profit was good for $020 per share which was a large beat compared to wall streets average estimate of a $017 loss per share that marks two consecutive quarters where analysts expected a loss but instead a profit was delivered despite critics hollering about gaap non-gaap accounting by tesla report was enough to send stock soaring to a new high - thats just epsthe good news continues because there are many other factors that arent earnings-related that paint a nice picture for tesla one important aspect a young growth company showing that demand still far outpaces supply which easily accomplished at tesla its planned growth for 40000 vehicles still seemingly on track companys recent purchase of land next to its current facility for future production expansion a good signalon top of demand already outpacing supply we have to keep mind that tesla unique that it has no traditional mainstream advertising - that could hugely benefit demand for tesla vehicles future its also still building out its infrastructure for supercharging stations to make its plan reality rather than a futuristic ploy tesla has plenty of growth plenty of positive factors going for it today - although i believe much of that baked into teslas high valuation but there one thing that slightly worries mea laughing matterduring teslas conference call earlier this week musk was asked by a respected morgan stanley analyst adam jonas about competition from bmws i3 his response was to laugh out loud for a few seconds time before gathering himself answering questionaside from being slightly unprofessional thats definitely arrogant thats type of arrogance we saw at detroits big three automakers right before their ignorance ran their respective businesses into ground obviously these are different circumstances but i would temper my laughter when facing companies with hundreds of millions of dollars that could be spent on evs to develop a vehicle that can compete with tesla i would especially temper my laughter when those companies are much better financial standing than past decadeconsider ford (nyse f ) for a split second a company that has recently proven it understands very well where to develop cars popular segments it already has six electrified vehicles has grown its market share to nearly 16% first half of 2013 through june ford sold more than 46000 electrified vehicles to be fair this cant be an apples-to-apples comparison with tesla sales because ford includes hybrids plug-in hybrids as well as its battery-electric vehiclesin fact ford hiring more than 200 new electrification engineers expanding its research facilities to speed development of hybrid evs ford has also invested more than $355 million to design engineer manufacture components for its ev lineup moreover $50 million will also be spent to invest research development facilities to reduce its ev development by as much as 25%as ev sales continue to grow into a bigger more profitable segment you can bet that big boys will have more to say musk will have less to laugh about for now teslas arrogance appears warranted -

leader has more visibly lavishly supported president-elect donald trump than elon musk -- few if any have a more complex relationship with china a country that trump has vowed to confront with higher tariffs other measuresmusk has a lot on line his best-known company electric vehicle maker tesla makes half its cars china tesla sells more cars china than anywhere except united states his local

that beijing may be able to turn musk into an influential ally trying to persuade trump to take a more conciliatory approach on tradewhen chinese leaders have an important message to convey to president trump elon musk would clearly be best conduit said michael dunne a longtime china automotive consultant now based san diegocompetition from china getting toughermany of musks other companies including his ventures solar energy large batteries face formidable competition from chinese businesses some of his businesses might benefit from a decoupling of chinese us economies steep tariffs initially imposed by trump his first term later increased by president joe biden have stopped a push by chinese automakers into us marketfrankly i think if there are not trade barriers established they will pretty much demolish most other companies world musk said on a tesla earnings call januarypractically all of musks rivals silicon valley seattle have focused on digital technologies but musk has built factories high-tech manufacturing industriesmusk competing global industries that chinese government finances heavily -- not only electric vehicles but also batteries solar energy space launches chinas state-controlled banking system ramped up net lending to industry to $670 billion last year from $83 billion 2019in just about every area where his companies focus there are many chinese competitors said scott kennedy a chinese business economics specialist at center for strategic international studies washington he basically industries where chinese are opponents as opposed

429,2024-11-22,on est monts ÿ bord du tesla cybercab la voiture lectrique ÿ 35 000 ª sans volant ni pdales,tesla a fait venir ÿ paris depuis les tats-unis sa nouvelle voiture lectrique le cybercab qui peut ¦tre achet par les particuliers sa particularit  il est dpourvu de pdales et de volants et sera compatible avec le service robotaxi on vous donne notre premier avistesla a dvoil le cybercab le 11 octobre 2024 et nous avons djÿ trait cette annonce en dtail sur survolts dans un article ddi cette fois-ci nous avons eu la chance dapprocher et m¦me de monter ÿ bord de cette nouvelle voiture lectrique le constructeur amricain a fait venir ÿ paris au showroom de madeleine un exemplaire du cybercab il sera accessible au public du samedi 23 novembre au 8 dcembrenous avons pu tourner autour de ce vhicule et monter ÿ bord pour nous faire un premier avis cest robin vidaste pour frandroid qui nous raconte tout cela dans une vido sur notre chane youtube que vous pouvez visionner ci-dessous et noubliez pas de vous abonner ÿ notre nouvelle chane youtube survolts si les sujets 100 % lectriques vous intressentsi vous voulez un rsum voici ce quen a pens notre amoureux des belles mcaniques et des voitures lectriquesrobin nous explique que ce qui la frapp en premier lieu   labsence de volant et de pdalier  pourquoi  car  il faut voir un peu ce vhicule comme le stade suprieur de lautopilot de tesla on avait djÿ lautopilot dans les model s model 3 model y etc qui permettait daller dun point a ÿ un point b en tout cas aux tats-unis sans toucher le volant ni les pdales mais qui ncessitait quand m¦me une supervision de la part du conducteur lide ici vous laurez compris cest quon na plus besoin de cette supervision et donc vous allez pouvoir rentrer dans votre vhicule vous installer dire je vais ÿ tel endroit et la voiture vous emmne vous navez rien ÿ faire vous pouvez regarder un film sur cet immense cran de 21 pouces ou alors carrment dormir prcisons ÿ ce sujet que nous avions pu essayer le fsd de tesla aux tats-unis en janvier 2024 et que nous avions t vraiment bluffs par lexprience comme vous pouvez le voir dans cette autre vidopour le moment nous ne sommes pas en prsence dune voiture de srie robin prcise que  cest encore un prototype mais on est a priori trs proche de la version finale du produit les tests ont dailleurs commenc au texas aux tats-unis une fois ÿ lintrieur robin nous livre son avis   alors quand on rentre ÿ lintrieur le premier dtail quon peut remarquer en dehors de labsence de volant de lcran immense et de labsence de pdales cest quon a seulement deux places et regardez les siges cest pas vraiment des siges quon a lhabitude de voir dans les voitures on est plus sur presque un fauteuil en fait quelque chose de plus confortable on a m¦me un petit accoudoir central mais forcment tesla conserve sa patte avec  quelque chose dassez minimaliste trs peu de boutons  on a les boutons pour le rglage des vitres et cet cran de 21 pouces qui servira surtout de divertissement en termes de confort robin nous dit quil a  vraiment normment despace pour mes jambes je fais quand m¦me un mtre quatre-vingt je suis pas un petit gabarit et vraiment lÿ je me sens vraiment trs trs bien pour le reste ÿ lintrieur on peut voir que la planche de bord a ressemble pas mal ÿ ce quon peut avoir dans les nouvelles tesla model 3 donc rien de vraiment dpaysant ici la scurit nest pas oublie   m¦me si tesla annonce que leurs voitures sont dix fois moins impliques dans des accidents de la route que les autres marques de voiture on a quand m¦me des ceintures de scurit faut pas r¦ver parce quon peut toujours ¦tre la victime dun autre usager en revanche  pas de place ÿ larrire donc on a une voiture qui est globalement plus petite que la tesla model 3 par contre on gagne un coffre absolument gigantesque niveau design  on a limpression un petit peu davoir un mini cybertruck vu de ct avec tout ouvert cest assez impressionnant avec ces portes qui souvrent en papillon et ce coffre immense un petit mot sur les roues aussi  qui sont assez spciales qui donnent vraiment un look spcial ÿ cette voiture ce nest pas une jante comme on a lhabitude de voir sur dautres voitures cest compltement ferm avec un enjoliveur qui donne vraiment une impression de pneus extr¦mement fins  mais selon robin  cest assez joli ÿ voir si a restera sur les versions finales du vhicule parce que lÿ on simagine que en roulant sur des routes un petit peu cabosses a risque de casser assez vite et pour le design en lui-m¦me robin nhsite pas ÿ nous donner son avis   moi personnellement je suis assez fan  avec une inspiration auprs du cybertruck avant dajouter   je trouve que le cybertruck est quand m¦me un petit peu trop gros ÿ mon go¯t mais ici a marche plutt pas mal et dailleurs je suis presque frustr de pas pouvoir la conduire moi-m¦me avec un volant et des pdales et justement est-ce quon pourra un jour conduire ce cybercab avec des pdales et un volant  tesla nous dit que non mais certaines rumeurs annoncent que lhypothtique tesla model 2 ÿ 25 000 dollars pourrait ¦tre base sur cette plateforme difficile de croire sur un tarif aussi bas quand on voit le prix annonc pour le cybercab par muskpour aller plus lointesla model 2  pourquoi la voiture lectrique abordable ÿ 25 000 $ serait en fait une mini model yle tesla cybercab devrait ¦tre  la tesla la moins chre du catalogue  car  la promesse delon musk cest de pouvoir acheter ce vhicule pour moins de trente mille dollars hors taxes alors attention puisque lÿ a inclut laide de ltat amricain de 7 500 dollars donc en ralit on est plus autour de 37 500 dollars hors taxes  a titre de comparaison la tesla model 3 la moins chre (grande autonomie propulsion) est actuellement vendue 42 490 dollars aux usa contre 44 990 euros en franceon estime un prix de vente denviron 35000 euros en europe mais attention la voiture ne devrait pas arriver sur les routes avant 2027 avec un dbut de production en 2026 a cest les promesses de musk et on a du mal ÿ le croire avec tous les retards accumuls sur les diffrents vhicules depuis plusieurs annesla bonne nouvelle cest que le cybercab pourrait bien vous rapporter de largent comme lexplique robin   cette voiture elle va proposer un service qui sappelle robotaxi qui est en gros une sorte de uber automatis cest-ÿ-dire que vous allez avoir votre application tesla vous allez commander un trajet et la voiture va venir toute seule vous chercher et vous amener ÿ lendroit souhait alors tout a videmment cest un service qui sera payant et dailleurs elon musk annonce que ce sera moins cher au kilomtre quun bus par exemple pour aller plus lointesla network  voici la nouvelle application cense rvolutionner la voiture lectriqueet comment gagner de largent  lexplication est simple   si vous ¦tes propritaire de ce vhicule vous allez pouvoir le mettre ÿ disposition de la flotte de vhicules robotaxi et ainsi vous allez ¦tre rmunr avec une voiture qui rapporte de largent sans rien faire pour ceux qui auraient peur que deux places soit trop justes tesla prcise que  80 % des trajets en taxi se font ÿ une ou deux personnes seulement ce service ne sera pas uniquement rserv aux cybercab musk a annonc que nimporte quelle tesla pourrait ¦tre compatible on peut donc imaginer des model s model x model y et model 3 parcourir les villes et faire gagner de largent ÿ leurs propritairesla grande problmatique pour le cybercab cest celle de la rglementation pour le moment faire rouler une voiture lectrique sans volant ni pdales ce nest pas possible partout tesla la bien compris et ralise ses essais au texas o la rglementation sur le sujet est trs libre mais pour le reste du monde cest une autre histoireest-ce que tesla proposera cette voiture avec un volant et des pdales pour dautres usages  la fameuse model 2 que tout le monde attend finalement,-0.1325,negative

434,2024-11-21,transcript what elon musk gains from a friend white house,gideon rachmanhello welcome to rachman review im gideon rachman chief foreign affairs commentator of financial times this weeks podcast about elon musk his relationship with donald trump my guest sebastian mallaby author of a bestselling book on silicon valley called power law senior fellow for international economics at council on foreign relations musk trump are now close alliance what do they want from each other can their relationship lastelon musk audio clipthe true test of someones character how they behave under fire (crowd cheering) we had one president who couldnt climb a flight of stairs another who was fist-pumping after getting shot (crowd cheering) fight fight fight blood coming down face now america home of brave theres no truer test than courage under fire so who do you want representing america (crowd cheering) yeah absolutelygideon rachmanelon musks decision to campaign alongside donald trump to throw his financial technological resources behind him was a crucial moment a remarkable election campaign 2020 musk says he voted for joe biden but hes certainly fully behind trump now musk worlds richest man trump will soon be worlds most powerful man so what are implications of alliance between two that was question i put to sebastian mallabysebastian mallabybut i think theres three things that elon musk might want from donald trump one would be to influence him on policy there i dont think hes gonna get very far because i think trump has got his own views on policy musk too busy to probably sustain a long engagement second thing he might want to actually deliver some ideas through this department of government efficiency doge i think there he might come up with cost-cutting ideas there are plenty around which he could resurface which would make a substantial difference to size of government spending trick there to implement them more than having ideas so his function as a doge outsider more ideas than implementation but still his prestige could push it along then third thing which most important by far you know musk going to want favours for his businesses from trump i think thats where one should focus most closelygideon rachmanso well come to those favours a second but do you think also that there was a strong element of ideological affinity at a certain point musk who had before trended liberal -- i think hed voted for hillary clinton 2016 -- becomes a trump true believer do we know why this do you think it ideological or its purely pragmaticsebastian mallabyyoure right there an ideological underpinning he very exercised -- musk -- about what he calls woke mind virus linked perhaps to his daughter transitioning hes fury about thatgideon rachmanso he hadi think he said that my son xavier dead a rather brutal formulation of thatsebastian mallabyexactly he also a sort of free speech maximalist when he bought twitter now x his rationale was that thered been censorship on twitter he wanted to take that away allow people to speak more freely these kinds of things which are basically on cultural right sort of free speech blending into a desire not to be too politically correct those do seem to have driven him quite a lot his actions last four five years i think that explains quite a lot of alignment with trumpbut its not just that hes also i think emblematic of a broader shift tech community which feels that democrats have moved left so when joe biden has a gathering of electric vehicle people fails to invite tesla but does invite trade union leaders musk was utterly furious theres a kind of sense which under bill clinton then maybe also barack obama democrats actively courted tech leaders now they kind of take them for granted theyre paying pricegideon rachmanso do you think that silicon valley which you know very well now i used to think of it as basically a pretty liberal place now trumps campsebastian mallabyit more democratic camp still than republican camp but there are things that democrats have done i mean take another example kamala harris floated this idea of taxing unrealised capital gainsgideon rachmanin other words youve made a paper gain but you havent sold it yetsebastian mallabyexactly so if youre a venture capitalist silicon valley youve put some money into a company company doing terrifically well it then raises more money also from another venture capitalist privately value has not gone up by 10 question should you pay tax on that capital gain when theres no liquid stock market position that establishes price transparently nor there an easy way for you to sell some of your shares to get cash to pay tax to tech community its absurd to pay what they call a dry tax other words a tax for your liquidgideon rachmanand harris had proposed thatsebastian mallabyand harris had proposed it or at least floated it it wasnt totally clear how seriously she meant it whether she was gonna do it but just mention of that idea was enough to have a lot of fairly non-political silicon valley leaders im thinking for example of bill gurley who a famous venture capitalist who a benchmark prime investor uber not an especially political figure basically but you know he just tore that to shreds i think quite rightly so actually i think its a stupid tax so i think there are ways which both tech community more broadly then musk as a sort of example of that have gotten fed up with both tax regulatory positions of democrats which they view as having moved to left whilst theyve stayed stationarygideon rachmanand what musks relationship with other sort of titans of silicon valley if i can put it that way because hes a pretty disputatious guy i think he openly feuding say with sam altman of openai at moment but you spend a lot of time california youre just back from there do they look at what hes doing think hes gone off reservation or he still a hero theresebastian mallabywell there remains an incredible respect for musk when it comes to engineering business getting stuff done when i was there just a week or so before election i spent several days wandering around talking to people artificial intelligence world its clear that musks ai effort which called x has a chat model called grok this rising force field musk has said he would assemble an enormous cluster of gpu chips really fast to make his system as powerful as openai people thought it couldnt be done less than 18 months he did it about four months so multiple people said to me wow you know elon absolutely on his game that guy just on a different levelgideon rachmanso you mentioned that musk catching up fast on ai that people think his ventures doing well what his attitude to ai because libertarian streak risk-taking streak suggests to me that he would from first principles be kind of guy who said dont worry about it full speed ahead but its a bit more complicated than thatsebastian mallabyyeah i mean musk somebody who worries about existential risk he founded tesla because he thought that climate change could doom humanity he founded spacex because he wants to turn humanity into a multi-planetary species so if indeed world wrecked they can go live on mars im not jokinggideon rachmanyeah he wears these t-shirts saying colonise marssebastian mallabyand same way when it comes to powerful ai hes always been somebody who worried about wiping out humanity he had this famous argument with larry page co-founder of google where larry page said you know its fine if ai displaces humans because what we care about preservation of intelligence if it turns out that evolutionarily machine intelligence just a superior form of intelligence then our kind of wetware fine for humanity to be displaced this was so anathema to many people but musk particular got so furious that he didnt speak to page who had been one of his best friends they really broke off relations over that so hes been a sort of safety maximalisthe started openai as a kind of anchor investor with a sort of safety thesis mind but at same time this actually not unique to him across ai community there a preoccupation with safety at same time an irrepressible desire to build technology so i expect when it comes to his own ai effort musk going to say look yes its dangerous but if its dangerous you have to trust someone like me to build it because ill do it responsibly you mustnt slow me down because if you do then youre handing leadership to some less responsible actor who by way may not be located united states might be arab gulf might be russian whatever so get out of my way although its dangerousgideon rachmanand do you think election of trump his close ally will benefit him also ai because there are several competing models will musk get another boost from thissebastian mallabyyes i think he will i mean hes already heading towards being sort of top five ai providers i think that what we can say that with trump white house there zero chance that any federal regulation would impede his progress towards being top five there could be state measures california has passed ai regulation they are very big players trump doesnt control them but terms of federal interventions hes clearly got a friend white house who has his backgideon rachmanand hes doing all this while he simultaneously trying to change american political system run spacex run teslasebastian mallabyand starlink another company called boring company neuralink i mean he has a whole empire of things it doesnt seem to stop him from pushing them ahead at breakneck speed so i think that respect for him as a business leader utterly undiluted undiminished that respect then tends to bleed into a more general idolatry because silicon valley currency of realm your network who you know knowing powerful people extremely important because you might be invited to invest their next deal or to ally with him some business thing you cant afford to be alienating somebody who as much of a force business as elon musk so i think theres a reluctance among people i would be chatting with even to criticise his politics because as a business ally hes too importantgideon rachmanand do you think his business now that his bet if i can put it that way on donald trump has paid off set to profit all sorts of wayssebastian mallabyyeah 100 per cent i mean if you look at what hes got right hes got tesla an electric-car maker which hugely dependent on government regulation government subsidy policy whether there are gonna be tariffs on chinese competitor evs so thats a business which very linked to what government does then there spacex where main customer government launching stuff into space for nasagideon rachmanand starlink i mean i think of it terms of its a satellite network it provides internet basically so while being a libertarian he also very very dependent on government buying stuff from him particularly spacexsebastian mallabyyeah absolutely fact funny enough spacex started a trend among other libertarian silicon valley people of thinking about working with government as being actually very attractive notion was this peter thiel particular who another of course libertarian who supported donald trump permanently last cycle 2016 i mean thiels argument has always been if youre doing a start-up your goal to become a monopoly how do you become a monopoly well one way you sell to a very awkward customer namely government where you have to jump through all kinds of hoops not become (inaudible) its very difficult to get with a government but once defence establishment starts buying your stuff then theyll probably continue itll be very hard for a competitor to come steal that business away from you so palantir peter thiels defence company was one example which was sort of pretty much inspired by spacex by elon musk peter thiel by way had invested spacex so he knew all about it then theres another one called anduril another defence tech company which peter thiels group backed again same thesis if you get there with government never mind fact that you might be libertarian this ideal customer (inaudible)gideon rachmanand going back to tesla part of trump campaigns rhetoric was cost doubt at times on climate change certainly saying that it was sort of woke nonsense to try to switch everybody to evs away from petroleum-based economy yet trump champion of evs how do you square that paradoxsebastian mallabywell trump contemptuous about climate change but he loves sort of american industrial champions so hes quite happy to talk up musk tesla say this a great example of a beautiful car with a beautiful guy building them that kind of thing so i think hes gonna square that circle he wont be pro-climate but he will be pro-teslagideon rachmanand tesla itself as you implied earlier chinese evs have been big story of past year but if trump imposes a massive tariff on chinese evs that leaves market for tesla united states doesnt itsebastian mallabyyeah 100 per cent i mean trump talking about 60 per cent tariffs on chinese exports that would be a good way of knocking out competition from chinese on a permanent basis so i think that would be nothing but good for teslagideon rachmanare there any american ev companies that could compete with teslasebastian mallabyi mean there are other electric vehicle components of all american car manufacturers but i think its fair to say that tesla has lead terms of software other angle on this that tesla has also worked a lot on autonomous technology if you go to san francisco now its actually google autonomous vehicle waymo which you can get as a taxi san francisco when i was having dinner with a friend who connected with openai he said at end well youre going home by waymo i said what do you mean i havent done that according to this random guy im having dinner with he never uses uber now because why would you want a driver front seat who might listen to your phone call annoy you by trying to make pleasant conversation you know you just want whole vehicle to yourself so you can do what you would do your living room therefore you use an autonomous vehicle only somebody very backward would consider otherwise so thats whats coming tesla main potential competitor to google this technology i think trump probably going to make it easier for tesla to road its vehicles outgideon rachmanbecause there have been regulatory block so farsebastian mallabyof course there are safety blocks of course there are probably excessive safety paranoia sense that human drivers do make mistakes kill people ev probably safer by this point but people want to point finger at them be afraid of robot so i think at margin its going to be easier for musk to roll out autonomous vehicles now that trump going to be presidentgideon rachmanwhat else do you think musk might want from trump terms of businesssebastian mallabywell one big annoyance for him being that there a federal subsidy to extend broadband connections rural america for reasons of lobbying cable companies which install this broadband by literally coming along with bulldozers digging up ground putting cables have cornered that market satellite-based option ie starlink musks solution has not been eligible for these federal subsidies musk i think rightly furious about that i suspect very soon thats gonna changegideon rachmanon china front though i mean one thing that does seem to unite all republicans most democrats too hostility to china we mentioned 60 per cent tariff but musk has made a huge bet on china hes i think biggest tesla factory world shanghaisebastian mallabythats right so i think something like half of teslas car production comes out of this enormous factory shanghai but theres a couple of things to note about that one that last i looked at numbers more than half of cars produced shanghai by tesla are sold within china so tariffs are irrelevant so you could have enormous american tariffs on any cars coming out of china it wouldnt matter to musk then other chunk of cars produced shanghai musk exporting them to europe australia so forth so he doesnt need to bring those cars back into us i think hes okgideon rachmanunless theres chinese retaliationsebastian mallabyyeah i mean chinese might go after him then that becomes a calculation both by china also actually by way for europe that when trump does stuff you dont like on trade front how broadly do you retaliate do you choose elon musk as one of your targets or are you cutting off your nose to spite your facegideon rachmanif you were advising european commission would you because i know theyre thinking about it should they go after musksebastian mallabyi dont think so i mean rationale for europes tariffs on electric vehicles from china which range up to anything around 25 30 per cent that byds so forth chinese companies have received enormous government subsidies to build their electric vehicles tesla factory shanghai has not had same subsidies so thats why theyre subject to a much lower tariff europe so i think its sort of less than 10 per cent on a tesla you know if europe wants to be prime exponent of rule of law these matters i dont think it should depart just say well we dont like elon musk because hes a friend of donald trumps that would seem to me to be a bit pettygideon rachmannow weve talked a lot about what musk might get from trump what does trump get from musksebastian mallabywell you know politics of course money power thats especially true of us where enormous amounts of money go into elections i think having musk at ready to pour cash into any trump political concerns gonna be valuable obvious thing that trump needs to get at least some of his agenda through congress if there are members of republican caucus who attempted to peel away oppose trump on something or other those senators or members of house could be threatened with a primary challenge that would be richly financed by elon musk i think hes already talked about this so one thing threat of musks money 2026 cycle which could be very valuable to donald trump other thing of course there twitter now called x musks personal following 203mn huge having him tweet on your behalf having him perhaps subtly uprank other people who are on your side making sure whatever speech moderation goes on not getting way of right-wing speech all these kinds of things could also be useful to donald trumpgideon rachmanand now we mentioned 2026 midterms do you think trump musk will still be friends 2026 these are both very headstrong people can they continue working together of course were guessing but whats your guesssebastian mallabyi dont think theyre going to have a close sort of bromance that lasts for very long i mean whats going on right now with reports of elon musk holed up at mar a lago trumps estate musk with his son popping out of family photographs being called new uncle of trump grandchildren i mean that level of honeymoon surely wont last because a) donald trump end gets bored of people doesnt want other people rivalling him or telling him what to do b) musk has several companies to run he gets bored as well i always think back to partnership that musk had with peter thiel when they were both doing digital payments so peter thiel founded paypal musk founded a rival company which was doing same thing which of course was called x they merged two for a while they collaborated but it got so absolutely you know murderous that one day when elon musk went away on honeymoon he was purged from his position as ceo of company by pro-thiel faction which got him booted out while he was on honeymoon so musk doesnt have a record of working for anybody else ever trump doesnt have a record for working for anybody else ever that two headstrong year it i dont think theyre going to be close no they could be more distant but collaborative a sort of oligarchic understanding that trump produces a stream of favours to musks businesses return musk produces political cover for donald trumpgideon rachmanso who do you think at moment more powerful man donald trump or elon musksebastian mallabyi think nobodys more powerful than president of united states i mean ultimately he has power to cut off regulatory favours government contracts change playing field i mean unfortunately broadening this conversation beyond just elon musk this precisely concern we all have about trump administration there just an enormous amount of power that can be used an unchecked fashion if you start sort of throwing lawsuits at innocent people just to intimidate them i think you know you just look at history of relationship between oligarchs president of russia which youve studied more than i have its totally clear that ultimately state beats businessgideon rachmanyeah to finish then do you think musk would be concerned i mean were sitting here london friends washington who are all quaking at thought that you raised that trump will use his power an arbitrary possibly unconstitutional fashion get away with it there anything musk do you think that would be concerned about that or he fully on board for thisgideon rachmanhes an intelligent man he must have noticed that hes riding a tiger sometimes tiger you know kicks you off eats you so hes got to be thinking about that risk but thing about elon musk that he always has adored risk he just loves risk one time he was driving peter thiel on way to a fundraising meeting a supercar that hed bought he smashed car which hit median strip on road took off into air spun around landed miraculously neither peter thiel nor elon musk were hurt but they got out looked at this wreck on ground thiel said to musk wow im sorry about your car musk was just laughing said funniest thing it wasnt insured he loves risk[music playing]gideon

business leader has more visibly lavishly supported president-elect donald j trump than elon musk -- few if any have a more complex relationship with china a country that mr trump has vowed to confront with higher tariffs other measuresmr musk has a lot on line his best-known company electric vehicle maker tesla makes half its cars china tesla sells more cars china than anywhere except united states his local competition getting stronger chinese regulators have not yet allowed tesla to offer its latest assisted-driving self-driving car technology while allowing chinese automakers to race ahead with similar systemsmr musk has personally appealed to chinas premier li qiang for permission to proceed with what tesla calls full self-driving as companys market share china has dwindled some experts have suggested that beijing may be able to turn mr musk into an influential ally trying to persuade mr trump to take a more conciliatory approach on tradewhen chinese leaders have an important message to convey to president trump elon musk would clearly be best conduit said michael dunne a longtime china automotive consultant now based san diegocompetition from china getting toughermany of mr musks other companies including his ventures solar energy large batteries face formidable competition from chinese businesses some of his businesses might benefit from a decoupling of chinese american economies steep tariffs initially imposed by mr trump his first term later increased by president biden have stopped a push by chinese automakers into american marketfrankly i

not only electric vehicles but also batteries solar energy space launches chinas state-controlled banking system ramped up net lending to industry to $670 billion last year from $83 billion 2019in

rivalries with state-linked chinese companies that also want to offer launches tesla energy produces large battery packs used by electricity grids for energy storage combination with solar or wind power a growing market otherwise dominated by chinachina now worlds main supplier of solar panels but tesla energy partnership with q cells of south korea still has a foothold that sector at a time when china produces most of worlds giant tunneling machines for construction of subways water systems military bases mr musk has established his own boring company southern texastesla still waiting on approval for full self-drivingmr musk faces tough competition from china most of his businesses but electric car sector more complicatedin addition to being a critical consumer market for tesla china

germany tesla has also imported electric car battery packs from china to united states to supplement its own production nevadachinese regulators have not yet allowed tesla to introduce full

447,2024-11-20,tesla powerwall best solar home backup ev companion | digital trends,solar power having solar panels on your home a fantastic way to conserve energy cut down on power bills especially if you live somewhere sunny like florida or california theres just one glaring issue when grid goes down you still lose power because of how its connected your solar panels cannot generate enough energy or keep it stored to keep your power on so essentially your power setup doesnt offer much benefit there unless you get a home power backup system more specifically something like a tesla powerwall a compact home battery that stores energy generated from grid that energy then used as a backup when traditional grid power unavailableto make it even more clear with a tesla powerwall power stays on even during a major blackout or outage its whole-home backup too which means you can power your lights appliances electronics you name it if youve ever had to throw away an entire refrigerators worth of spoiled food because of a multi-day outage -- like i have -- youll certainly appreciate option to keep your appliances running but thats not all it can do tesla powerwall an excellent companion for tesla ev owners creating an entire smart ecosystem of power lets exploregenerating whole-home backup power from solartypically if power goes out youd need to connect a generator to your home to get things back up running gas generators are loud they have to remain outside -- because fumes are dangerous -- theyre not exactly convenient they often come heavy bulky form factors it takes a bit of work to get them set up thats even more challenging during a huge storm or weather event but tesla powerwall none of those things instead its a battery backup that connects to your local home power your solar systembasically your solar panels generate energy like normal while excess power stored tesla powerwall then when power goes out powerwall takes over supplying backup power you need powerwall automatically detects outage instantly powers your home with stored backup energy even better a feature called storm watch automatically ensures your powerwall fully charged before a major storm hits that way youre always prepared powerwall also expandable similar to portable power stations meaning you can upgrade capacity to handle power more more gear it can be used with or without solar as wellplus smart energy controls with tesla appevery powerwall features built-in energy monitoring metering smart controls moreover it syncs with tesla app so at any time you can control configure your system using your phone or check energy usage other stats you can also customize your setup like setting up system to only charge when your local utilitys electricity costs are low to save even more money or discharging automatically when costs are high to use less grid power you can fine-tune experience use your power how you want no more staying beholden to local utility companiespowerwall also qualifies for a 30% federal tax credit as of 2023 that residential federal investment tax credit gets you money back regardless of power source making it a solid investment all around if you already have solar then theres really no reason not to opt for a powerwall home battery backup solution that allows you to actually use solar power youre generating -- your solar power -- even when grid downthe solar tesla ecosystem where its atbeyond saving money being able to use solar as a home backup tesla powerwall opens up another opportunity especially for tesla ev owners powerwall coordinates with tesla vehicles offering enhanced vehicle charging support during outages but heres thing it charges vehicles without exceeding energy power capabilities of battery systemheres how it works during an outage powerwall charges your tesla based on charging threshold that threshold what specifically determines how much energy routed to vehicle other words powerwall will never go below set threshold (capacity) once it drops below threshold vehicle charging stops safely powerwall continues to provide backup power to your home as normal even better if your home equipped with solar -- why wouldnt it be -- that energy can help charge powerwall by proxy charge your tesla evprovided you have right connectors installed you can leave everything connected to be managed automatically by tesla powerwall system you dont have to go your garage hook everything up unhook everything when its done keep fiddling with cables ports its all done managed automatically you can always monitor whats happening through tesla app that not only brings you tons of convenience but peace of mind more so during major events like storms outages hurricanesthe ultimate solar home backup ev companionfrankly if you have a solar system installed on your home you dont have a home battery backup connected like a tesla powerwall youre not using it to its full potential youre definitely losing benefits on your investment powerwall can keep power on during outages it can help you conserve energy cut down on your power bill even more best of all its an excellent tesla ev companion allowing you to charge your vehicle as needed whether during an outage or through solar energyit doesnt matter how rare outages are near you -- if theyre frequent this definitely doesnt apply -- first time you lose all of your food cant stay cool or warm have to go without power for days youll truly appreciate existence of technology such as this i highly recommend equipping your home with a tesla powerwall before it gets to that point youll always be prepared for whatever comes your way you can continue charging your ev without racking up your power

448,2024-11-20,automotive ecatombe europea la lezione di byd e tesla - agenda digitale,partiamo da una domanda e se la crisi dellautomotive europeo non fosse altro che una crisi del modello di impresa europeafacciamo un poco dordine per capire se il crollo di competitivitÿ dellautomotive europeo sia dato dalla narrazione che intervista dopo intervista i ceo protagonisti raccontano - sintetizzando dumping cinese costi ingestibili - oppure se ci troviamo di fronte a una crisi di managementcome primo punto di vista quindi diamo uno sguardo ai campioni che di questa crisi stanno approfittando uno a oriente ed uno ad occidente e alla storia che ne ha decretato il successoanche se byd nasce un poco prima nel 1995 per entrambe le societÿ coincidenza vuole veder nascere la componente automotive nel 2003 entrambe le societÿ quindi hanno identificato un problema le emissioni e linefficienza del settore entrambe hanno trovato uguale soluzione la pi ovvia unauto elettrica a batteriai motivi sottolineati anche da tutti i report che analizzano scientificamente il problema sono due il primo lefficienza energetica del sistema batteria inverter motore elettrico  circa tre volte quella del miglior turbodiesel dellepoca il secondo  se dobbiamo andare di rinnovabili mettere la corrente una batteria  molto pi efficiente di qualsiasi sistema di conversione elettrochimica vedi idrogeno e-fuel etc anche qui da 2 a 4 voltedietro entrambe le aziende ci sono sicuramente due personalitÿ visionarie elon musk e wang chuanfu ma giÿ quegli anni si puý vedere come lidea della mobilitÿ elettrica sia anche la scommessa del partito comunista cinese e vede nel terzo visionario wan gang colui che ha convinto i cinesi a puntare tutto sullelettrico il vero padre dellauto elettrica moderna ben prima di musk &c laureato nel 91 germania passa i primi anni audi e a fine anni novanta convince il governo cinese ad un all-in sullauto elettricacon queste argomentazioni semplici linquinamento delle cittÿ cinesi  alle stelle la cina deve anche ridurre la sua dipendenza dallestero particolare le importazioni di petrolio competere con gli europei sullauto tradizionale non  alla portata il divario non  colmabile lui  cosª credibile che i cinesi iniziano a credere sullauto elettrica la filiera automotive cina cera giÿ sullelettrico lesperienza su batterie ed elettronica pure e nel 2001 diventa progetto prioritario nel piano quinquennale di ricerca del partito comunista cinesewan nel 2007 diventa ministro della scienza ed quel momento tutto accelera nel 2009 il governo inizia con i sussidi per le aziende produttrici (anche occidentali) dando due certezze da una parte gli aiuti dallaltra la creazione di un mercato interno anche attraverso meccanismi per cui le auto elettriche non erano sottoposte a limiti di acquisto nelle grandi cittÿ come pechino mentre quelle a combustione erano razionatenel 2010 investe nella transizione elettrica per il trasporto pubblico assicurando appalti alle aziende che cosª avevano un mercato su come svilupparsi dal 2009 al 2022 il governo investe aiuti 29 miliardi di dollari aiutima ancora non basta pur avendo i pi grandi player mondiali sul proprio territorio il partito ne intuisce i limiti i soli aiuti non renderanno i produttori cinesi capaci di competere a livello mondiale la competizione con i produttori storici impiantanti cina  solo rendita bisogna che i cinesi competano con qualcuno che linnovazione la sta facendo sul serio quindi applica il principio per diventare un pugile da medaglia doro  utile avere uno sparring partner che sia campione del mondo ed ecco che nel 2019 convince elon musk ad investire cina e lo fa offrendo condizioni uniche che nessun altro gruppo industriale automotive ha mai ottenuto primaad esempio non pretende una joint venture la tesla di shanghai  una societÿ al 100% tesla offre un luogo perfetto per facilitare lexportil governo concede a tesla i diritti duso del terreno per un periodo iniziale di 50 anni 521 milioni di dollari prestiti da banche cinesi a tassi di interesse favorevoli e 82 milioni di dollari finanziamenti a fondo perdutotempi di realizzazione alla cinese condizioni che non sono mai state offerte n prima n dopo a nessun player stranierolo scopo  semplice far competere i cinesi con un rivale avanzato far imparare i fornitori ad operare nel mercato del futuro secondo gli standard del futuro cosª come dietro la volkswagen migliaia di imprese cinesi hanno imparato a lavorare nella meccanica e filiere meccaniche con standard di livello globale i cui prodotti hanno successivamente invaso il mondo cosª come dietro la apple fornitori cinesi hanno imparato la micromeccanica e lelettronica con cui hanno inondato il mondo con prodotti di successo cosª come successo nei treni e nelle navi e succederÿ negli aerei adesso era il turno dellautomobile del futuro non concentrandosi su medie tecnologie obsolete ma sullo smartphone a quattro ruoteil piano per il mercato domestico funziona alla grande oggi il mercato cinese supera i 6 milioni di automobili presenta centinaia di modelli caratterizzati da prezzi bassi e tanta innovazione e pur avendo un reddito pro-capite di circa 13000 dollari contro i 35000 europei ha visto unauto su due venduta sul mercato domestico essere elettricatornando europa i player europei presenti cina hanno avuto gli stessi livelli di aiuto di molti produttori cinesi ed hanno assistito diretta allattuazione del pianoanche se non nella totalitÿ del parco auto i segnali che nel futuro della mobilitÿ ci sarebbe stata la trazione elettrica cerano da tempo la prima generazione della 500 elettrica data 2013 il progetto ze di renault che portý poi alla renault zoe  del 2008come  possibile che la potenza dellautomotive europeo non abbia saputo competerei numeri sono impietosi nel 2018 (per avere un anno precovid) tesla perdeva 1 miliardo di euro fatturava 21 miliardi e vendeva 240000 auto meno di un medio stabilimento di un qualsiasi player europeo e molto meno delle grandi fabbriche europee giro per il mondo byd neanche era visibile nelle statistiche con ricavi per 120 milionise prendiamo il 2018 ma anche 2019 o 2020 abbiamo un mercato automotive cui  chiaro il futuro elettrico la california ma anche lue lo avevano giÿ legiferato il mercato delle quotazioni di borsa lo aveva giÿ assimilato con differenze di multipli monstre  evidente che una parte importante del futuro della mobilitÿ sarÿ elettrico se guardiamo a tesla e byd di quegli anni hanno risorse finanziare capacitÿ industriale e di marketing ridicole rispetto ai player del automotivenel 2018 per avere un metro quasi la metÿ delle auto prodotte al mondo era made eu 42 milioni su 96 milioni e con i player europei leader sul mercato cinese con il solo gruppo volkswagen che aveva una quota del 50% sul mercato cinese lidea che quindi byd e cinesi da una parte e tesla dallaltra avessero la dimensione per competere con le economie di scala di cotanti giganti sembra una barzelletta sono gli stessi anni cui i ceo delle principali case non facevano altro che dire a mezzo stampa che per sopravvivere bisognava avare una dimensione di almeno dieci milioni di autoveicoli figuriamoci poche centinaia di migliaiasono anche gli anni cui un ceo europeo molto quotato dalla stampa pregava i consumatori di non comprare ad esempio la 500 elettrica quanto perdita stesse perdite che perý sono state usate da tesla e byd per imparare a fare un prodotto competitivo ad acquisire dati a creare un mercato lo stesso ceo sosteneva che il giorno cui sarebbe servito avere auto elettriche i player europei avrebbero colmato gap un attimose guardiamo i dati di spesa r&d il confronto  ancora pi impietoso europa parliamo di una media di circa 50mldª/annui spesi dalle principali case automobilistiche con un picco nel 2023 a 73mld/ªquindi anche lato r&d la potenza di fuoco dellautomotive europeo era ed  ancora oggi enorme incomparabile a tesla e byd sempre tesla nel 2019 spendeva a malapena 15 miliardi per arrivare a 4 mld/ª nel 2023 cui perý abbiamo anche i robot optimus i chip per supercomputer dojo e molti altri progetti che non riguardano il mondo autouna spesa che non raggiunge il 5% di quanto spendono dellr&d i big europei come  possibile allora la crisi attuale  inutile girarci intorno gli indizi portano al managementbyd e tesla sono aziende a guidate da imprenditori visionari che fanno le cose non perch le chiede il mercato ma per creare il mercatolautomotive europeo dello scorso anno ha realizzato pi di cento miliardi di utili tra case e fornitori e tra gli investimenti per il futuro non abbiamo visto le mega fabbriche di batteria le nuove tecnologie quasi tutte stand-by con la giustificazione non abbiamo successo con gli attuali modelli e siamo attesa che ci sia la domanda del mercato quindi riacquisto di azioni proprie che tradotto italiano vuol dire facciamo contenti gli azionisti facendo alzare artificialmente il valore delle loro quote e incassiamo mega premi da stock optionstellantis lo scorso anno ha fatto utili per quasi 19 miliardi negli ultimi 2 anni la sola liquiditÿ usata per riacquistare azioni proprie  stata superiore al budget r&d di teslama ci sono due aspetti che ancora lautomotive europeo non ha compreso serve vera innovazione che passa da metodo di lavoro e supply chain le rendite sono finitealla base del successo di questi nuovi piccoli player che crescono a doppia cifra c il metodo di lavoro molto pi simile ad una startup della silicon valley che alle grandi industrie manufatturiere la capacitÿ di partire da un foglio bianco ed attraverso tentativi di innovazione molto frequenti e ravvicinati tra loro cercare la strada giusta dipendenti motivati e coinvolti nei progetti senza preoccuparsi di una supply chain cosª facendo hanno cambiato il modo di progettare e costruire auto oggi una tesla ed una byd sono quasi interamente made tesla e byded ecco che quindi una tesla ha una sola centralina che gestisce dallinfotainment allautopilot ai tergicristalli una media utilitaria europea ne ha pi 50 che spesso non parlano tra di loro non aggiornabili gran parte fornite da terze partimentre tesla e ormai molti cinesi realizzano il pianale il telaio frontale o quello posteriore un unico componente grazie allo stampaggio ad iniezione dellalluminio il famoso megacasting i produttori europei ancora usano lo stampaggio di lamiere saldate con tempi di produzione incredibilmente pi lunghi decine di componenti e precisioni e rigiditÿ non confrontabilimentre ormai sia per i cinesi che per tesla il software  la grande business unit che permette di creare il vantaggio competitivo aggiornabile on-air- che porta innovazione sui componenti dalla gestione della batteria allerogazione della potenza dalla user experience allinfotainment europa abbiamo brand anche di lusso che per avere un sistema decente si devono appoggiare un google o apple e magari il supporto lo forniscono pure a pagamentotesla byd catl samsung panasonic etc investono miliardi sulle linee di produzione delle batterie per migliorare processi non aspettando la domanda se guardiamo quanto tempo ha dovuto spendere tesla per imparare a produrre modo decente il rivoluzionario formato di batterie 4680 abbiamo un metro della production hell dellindustria delle batterie introdotta ufficialmente nel 2020  realmente riuscita a essere efficiente nella produzione nel 2024 gli europei non hanno neanche iniziato ad impararenegli ultimi dieci anni cosa ha introdotto lautomotive europeo quali fabbriche ha costruito ha semplicemente bussato alla porta di cinesi e coreani per comprare le batterie alcuni casi proprio il prodotto giÿ pronto quando arriveranno al mercato saranno obsoleti con cinesi americani e coreani 3 generazioni avanti e con costi pi bassila recente partnership tra il gruppo volkswagen e rivian per avere accesso al software e la quasi chiusura della divisione interna software cariad la dice lunga sulla difficoltÿ della prima nel gestire house queste innovazionicome se ne esce a sentire i vari attori europei al netto di luca de meo ceo renault non se ne esce si parla di costi di fabbriche chiuse di aiuti pubblici ma mai di vera innovazione di prodotti che i consumatori vogliano acquistare ad un prezzo che sono disposti a pagare come le varie kodak blockbuster nokia blackberry o la fine che ha fatto la rust valley sembra il preludio di una ecatombe con una aggravante pi che preoccuparci del come salvare aziende le cui strutture interne rendono impossibili tempi ragionevoli le innovazioni dovremmo preoccuparci del perch non ci sia una byd o tesla europea cosª come non c una amazon facebook netflix microsoft open ai etc europeadelle prime 10 aziende europee per capitalizzazione la pi recente  sap che ha 52 anni imparare dallesperienza cinese potrebbe essere questo caso molto utile domandiamoci se  possibile per una startup europea vendere innovazione ad una istituzione pubblica facciamo un esempio pi chiaro partiamo dagli usa spacex  diventata quello che  oggi grazie ad un contratto vinto nel 2006 senza che fesse riuscita a completare allepoca una sola missione committente nasa da quasi 400 mln per il commercial orbital transportation services (cots) grazie a questo contratto ha attirato investitori e talentichiediamoci se europa una startup allo stesso stadio senza missioni di successo avesse potuto vincere un contratto da quasi 400 milioni con esa la dinamica europea sarebbe stata mega-partneship pubblico privato capofila i vari airbus ariane etc 20 universitÿ e 10 paesi coinvolti 4 miliardi di spesa e come output un lanciatore obsoleto con 20 anni di ritardonon  uniperbole ma la descrizione del programma ariane 6 costato 43 miliardi di dollari con risultato un lanciatore che costa 75 milioni di euro a lancio con oltre un decennio di ritardodomandiamoci se ha senso come europa spendere annualmente 328 miliardi r&d molto pi dei cinesi se questo  il risultato non vi  stata una presenza significativa nei settori dellinnovazione sviluppati negli ultimi 30 anni questo riflette un problema di fondo a livello europeo pensare che grandi aziende e grandi budget uguale innovazione quando il luogo peggiore  pi improbabile per fare innovazione sono le realtÿ consolidate dove linnovazione vera quella disruptive pi che una opportunitÿ  un problema molto grosso da gestire ed ecco che abbiamo probabilmente dedicato pi tempo ad innovare i fari delle automobili

456,2024-11-22,elon musk donald trump seem besotted where their bromance headed,during his victory speech on election night donald trump touched on most of standard topics for such occasions he thanked his supporters his staff he praised his wife children he pledged to keep faith with voters but mostly he talked about elon musk fully 17% of his remarks -- as much time as he spent sketching out his plans for his presidency -- were devoted to super-genius who had taken a break from managing his various businesses to help mr trumps campaign he banged on about mr musks generosity his efficiency most of all technological prowess of his firms thats why i love you elonmr musk worlds richest man mr trump soon to be worlds most powerful are throes of a heady bromance pair have been inseparable since election with mr musk accompanying mr trump to washington to meet republicans congress mr trump heading to texas with mr musk to watch a test flight of a rocket built by spacex one of mr musks firmsmr musk who styles himself first buddy appears to be involved every element of presidential transition he sitting on interviews with prospective nominees to cabinet he has himself been named as co-head of a new department of government efficiency (doge) which supposed to slash both red tape wasteful spending he has joined mr trumps calls with world leaders such as volodymyr zelensky president of ukraine he has also conducted freelance diplomacy on his own meeting irans ambassador to un according to new york timesthe hope that mr musk may bring a little business nous technical wizardry to trump administration alluring some blue-sky thinking could help diminish americas yawning budget deficit of about 6% of gdp overhaul its often clunky bureaucracy but there are also many reasons to worry about mr musks ascendancy there will certainly be troubling conflicts of interest part mr musk interested deregulation after all owing to many pesky rules hemming his companies critics also fear that americas government may become dangerously reliant on a single individual especially realm of space satellites mr musks forays into foreign policy could jeopardise both his own business interests americas diplomatic goals perhaps most pressing question whether bromance can last given that both men are known to have massive egos frequent fallings-out with friends colleagues stage set short for a tumultuous psychodrama with global ramificationsboth messrs musk trump have already benefited hugely from their friendship mr musk thought to have spent about $200m to help get mr trump elected an enormous amount given that total declared spending so far of campaign outside groups about $11bn (that will rise as final disclosures are filed) mr musk played a big part efforts to turn out voters swing states focusing especially on those with little interest politics at very least that allowed campaign to divert its limited funds to other purposes it may also have helped galvanise support for mr trump among young men mr trump whose electoral pitch stresses his success as a businessman clearly revelled endorsement of such a celebrated entrepreneur that mr musk owns x a social-media platform favoured by political types used it to cheerlead energetically for mr trump was another bonusthe benefits to mr musk of bromance have been even bigger since election market capitalisation of tesla electric-vehicle (ev) firm that accounts for about two-thirds of his wealth has grown by $300bn that increment alone more than double combined market value of general motors ford stellantis big three carmakers of detroit although americas stockmarket has risen across board teslas ascent has been steeper (see chart) as mr musk owns roughly 20% of firm its surge has boosted his personal wealth by $60bn next biggest firm mr musks portfolio spacex privately held so jump its value harder to gauge but reports suggest its shares also command a much higher price than before electioninvestors clearly think that mr trumps presidency will be good for mr musks firms there are three broad explanations first government a big customer of spacex particular with which it has signed over $15bn contracts over past decade nasa accounts for most of this but some transactions are for military purposes spacex has a $14m contract with us space force (the little sister of air force) to provide communications to ukrainian armed forces government until november 30th through its starlink satellite network space force also paying spacex $733m to carry satellites into orbit pentagon has plans to incorporate 100 satellites from spacexs military division starshield into its own communications network starshield also has a $18bn contract to help secretive national reconnaissance office build spy satellites space development agency has a $149m contract to send messages between spacex satellites by laser so onpresumably more such custom could be forthcoming especially from an administration well disposed towards mr musk as it spacex conducted 90% of all orbital launches america 2023 government agencies accounted for more than 20% of its business by same token during mr trumps first term federal communications commission (fcc) offered starlink subsidies to help expand access to broadband rural areas but a payout of almost $900m was rescinded during joe bidens presidency it could be reinstated mr trumps second termthe stringency with which government enforces regulations also has an impact on mr musks firms they are subject of 20-odd investigations reviews by different federal agencies national labour relations board for example upset about how mr musk has handled workers campaigns to unionise at tesla department of transportation has complained about way neuralink mr musks brain-implant company moves hazardous materials around fish wildlife service thinks spacex has not done enough to protect nests of birds near a launch site for its rockets texas a less exacting administration could make all these problems go awayin grand scheme of mr musks business empire however his contracts with government are small change regulators complaints are minor irritations his companies are worth well over $1trn his personal wealth estimated at about $360bn for all spacexs government contracts majority of its revenue comes from starlink almost all of whose customers are commercialby far most material way trump administration could affect his fortunes by drafting new regulations rescinding old ones mr musk has long maintained that teslas future hinges on successful development of autonomous vehicles at moment autonomous driving regulated at state level putting tesla at a disadvantage to waymo a subsidiary of alphabet firm that owns google waymo already operates robotaxis a handful of cities whereas tesla has yet to launch any fully autonomous services after bloomberg reported on november 17th that mr trumps transition team had told advisers it plans to make a federal self-driving framework a priority teslas shares soared while those of uber lyft which could be hit by competition fell mr trump also reported to have invited mr musk to join a call with sundar pichai boss of alphabet -- an extraordinary opportunity for a commercial rivalanother potential trump policy scrapping of a generous tax credit for evs would also have a big impact on tesla although it would make firms cars more expensive it would hurt other american producers more since teslas costs are lower it would be devastating for our competitors gloats mr musk fact end of credit along with higher tariffs (another trump pledge) might be especially advantageous to tesla whose evs have highest share of parts made north america industry both domestic foreign rivals would be hamstrungspacexs fortunes too are heavily dependent on regulators it has received fccs approval to launch 12000 satellites (it already has more than 6000 orbit) but

459,2024-11-21,elon musk donald trump seem besotted where their bromance headed,d victory speech on election night donald trump touched on most of standard topics for such occasions he thanked his supporters his staff he praised his wife children he pledged to keep faith with voters but mostly he talked about elon musk fully 17% of his remarks -- as much time as he spent sketching out his plans for his presidency -- were devoted to super-genius who had taken a break from managing his various businesses to help mr trumps campaign he banged on about mr musks generosity his efficiency most of all technological prowess of his firms thats why i love you elonmr musk worlds richest man mr trump soon to be worlds most powerful are throes of a heady bromance pair have been inseparable since election with mr musk accompanying mr trump to washington to meet republicans congress mr trump heading to texas with mr musk to watch a test flight of a rocket built by spacex one of mr musks firmsmr musk who styles himself first buddy appears to be involved every element of presidential transition he sitting on interviews with prospective nominees to cabinet he has himself been named as co-head of a new department of government efficiency () which supposed to slash both red tape wasteful spending he has joined mr trumps calls with world leaders such as volodymyr zelensky president of ukraine he has also conducted freelance diplomacy on his own meeting irans ambassador to  according to new york timesthe hope that mr musk may bring a little business nous technical wizardry to trump administration alluring some blue-sky thinking could help diminish americas yawning budget deficit of about 6% of  overhaul its often clunky bureaucracy but there are also many reasons to worry about mr musks ascendancy there will certainly be troubling conflicts of interest part mr musk interested deregulation after all owing to many pesky rules hemming his companies critics also fear that americas government may become dangerously reliant on a single individual especially realm of space satellites mr musks forays into foreign policy could jeopardise both his own business interests americas diplomatic goals perhaps most pressing question whether bromance can last given that both men are known to have massive egos frequent fallings-out with friends colleagues stage set short for a tumultuous psychodrama with global ramificationsboth messrs musk trump have already benefited hugely from their friendship mr musk thought to have spent about $200m to help get mr trump elected an enormous amount given that total declared spending so far of campaign outside groups about $11bn (that will rise as final disclosures are filed) mr musk played a big part efforts to turn out voters swing states focusing especially on those with little interest politics at very least that allowed campaign to divert its limited funds to other purposes it may also have helped galvanise support for mr trump among young men mr trump whose electoral pitch stresses his success as a businessman clearly revelled endorsement of such a celebrated entrepreneur that mr musk owns x a social-media platform favoured by political types used it to cheerlead energetically for mr trump was another bonusthe benefits to mr musk of bromance have been even bigger since election market capitalisation of tesla electric-vehicle () firm that accounts for about two-thirds of his wealth has grown by $300bn that increment alone more than double combined market value of general motors ford stellantis big three carmakers of detroit although americas stockmarket has risen across board teslas ascent has been steeper (see chart) as mr musk owns roughly 20% of firm its surge has boosted his personal wealth by $60bn next biggest firm mr musks portfolio spacex privately held so jump its value harder to gauge but reports suggest its shares also command a much higher price than before electioninvestors clearly think that mr trumps presidency will be good for mr musks firms there are three broad explanations first government a big customer of spacex particular with which it has signed over $15bn contracts over past decade accounts for most of this but some transactions are for military purposes spacex has a $14m contract with space force (the little sister of air force) to provide communications to ukrainian armed forces government until november 30th through its starlink satellite network space force also paying spacex $733m to carry satellites into orbit pentagon has plans to incorporate 100 satellites from spacexs military division starshield into its own communications network starshield also has a $18bn contract to help secretive national reconnaissance office build spy satellites space development agency has a $149m contract to send messages between spacex satellites by laser so onpresumably more such custom could be forthcoming especially from an administration well disposed towards mr musk as it spacex conducted 90% of all orbital launches america 2023 government agencies accounted for more than 20% of its business by same token during mr trumps first term federal communications commission () offered starlink subsidies to help expand access to broadband rural areas but a payout of almost $900m was rescinded during joe bidens presidency it could be reinstated mr trumps second termthe stringency with which government enforces regulations also has an impact on mr musks firms they are subject of 20-odd investigations reviews by different federal agencies national labour relations board for example upset about how mr musk has handled workers campaigns to unionise at tesla department of transportation has complained about way neuralink mr musks brain-implant company moves hazardous materials around fish wildlife service thinks spacex has not done enough to protect nests of birds near a launch site for its rockets texas a less exacting administration could make all these problems go awayin grand scheme of mr musks business empire however his contracts with government are small change regulators complaints are minor irritations his companies are worth well over $1trn his personal wealth estimated at about $360bn for all spacexs government contracts majority of its revenue comes from starlink almost all of whose customers are commercialby far most material way trump administration could affect his fortunes by drafting new regulations rescinding old ones mr musk has long maintained that teslas future hinges on successful development of autonomous vehicles at moment autonomous driving regulated at state level putting tesla at a disadvantage to waymo a subsidiary of alphabet firm that owns google waymo already operates robotaxis a handful of cities whereas tesla has yet to launch any fully autonomous services after bloomberg reported on november 17th that mr trumps transition team had told advisers it plans to make a federal self-driving framework a priority teslas shares soared while those of uber lyft which could be hit by competition fell mr trump also reported to have invited mr musk to join a call with sundar pichai boss of alphabet -- an extraordinary opportunity for a commercial rivalanother potential trump policy scrapping of a generous tax credit for s would also have a big impact on tesla although it would make firms cars more expensive it would hurt other american producers more since teslas costs are lower it would be devastating for our competitors gloats mr musk fact end of credit along with higher tariffs (another trump pledge) might be especially advantageous to tesla whose s have highest share of parts made north america industry both domestic foreign rivals would be

owned by musk) to express his support for trump campaignand since becoming president-elect a lot of information has come out of trump camp regarding potential policy changes he will be looking to implement with help of a republican-controlled congressas these updates have hit news one particular analyst on wall street has been abnormally bullish on teslas prospects under a trump administration

way for teslas autonomous driving vision to enter fast laneives very well may be right -- just take this recent post on x from prominent financial political contributor unusual whalesin my eyes griffin team at citadel may have shared a similar mindset to that of ives as such their decision to buy tesla stock prior to trump securing presidency was rooted belief that musks relationship with

#1 (strong buy) stock tesla for a while now (we are up more than 100% name currently) my last bull of day article i also wrote about stockhowever as i have dug further into story i am becoming more bullish my view those who missed out on move so far should not fret as 2025 will likely be a breakout year for company below are top three ways trump victory will be bullish for tesla 20251 trump deregulation plans are bullish for teslaceo elon musk has said that he betting teslas future on autonomous driving robotaxis thus far alphabetis winning battle for robotaxi supremacy while teslas full self driving (fsd) still requires a human to be behind wheel waymos robotaxis are live four cities phoenix arizona los angeles san francisco austin while waymo may win battle robotaxi buildout early inningsearlier this weekthe trump team promised to cut back regulations on autonomous driving news huge for tesla because strict regulations have prevented tesla from rolling out its delayed (and highly anticipated) robotaxis further sean duffy who trump named as his pick for secretary of transportation another bullish signal for stock 2018 remarks duffy said that av technology can be remarkable keeping our families kids safe2 ev credit roll back will crush competitionlast week tsla shares dumped nearly 6% after trump team announced they would sunset generous electric vehicle (ev) tax credits provided by outgoing biden administration ev credits part of inflation reduction act (ira) provided tax credits of up to $7500 for qualified new clean vehiclesthough tsla shares sold off on ev tax credit sunset news they were likely searching for a reason after 29% explosion following us presidential results news stealthy bullish for tesla because tax credit removal will have more of an impact on low-margin ev competitors for instance ev pure play rivianhas negative profit margins further traditional automakers like fordhave profit margins of just 193% while tesla enjoys margins of nearly 9% other words competitor profit margins will be squeezed legacy automakers will be forced to focus on higher- margin cars that run on fossil fuels3 trump to levy tariffsanother core tenant

505,2024-11-21,faster charging doesnt help as much as we think,if you look around on social media people have a lot of bad to say about chevy bolt it charges slower than most evs these days with its charging curve its not uncommon to spend an hour at a charging station plus some people are habit of charging them up to 100% instead of just getting enough charge to get to next charger leading to even longer time spent hogging up a stall while there are nuts like me who use one to tow a trailer 4200 miles most ev fans online tell you that bolts basically unusable for road tripsbut what we havent really seen what happens when a bolt goes head to head against what most people consider gold standard for ev road trips a tesla but now we have that because ev geek on youtube tested to see how much time driving a cheap ev really loses youthey start out at franklins charging little rock arkansas (a place ive written about before) goal to do southern sprint from little rock to austin on their way to electrify expo it was obvious who would win this race with model y having faster charging greater range likely access to some v2 superchargers that bolt cant use but question whether it would make a huge difference or a small onereally difference range wasnt that much by epa rating model y has a range of 288 miles while bolt (non-euv) has an epa range of about 260 miles most superchargers are open to bolt now (via adapter) so its mostly going to come down to charging speed 55 kw vs 250 kw (maximum) a big deal but altogether how muchthere were some rules they werent trying to do an actual cannonball-style race so both cars were limited to 5 mph over limit arkansas thats mostly 80 mph while texas its pretty much same they used gps speed not necessarily car speedometer for that drive for both started at exactly 9 am with 100% chargefor trip planning with abrp bolt had an estimated trip time of about 10 hours with 3 charging stops over 500 mile trip stops were predicted to be somewhat long as there are very few places to charge there was very little choice teslas trip plan (via in-car trip planning) was very similar with three shorter stops basically same places predicted time was about 8 hours 45 minutesbecause they were both aiming for about 80 mph cars stayed pretty close together as they were leaving little rock metro area cars were side by side after bolt got behind traffic making for a pretty even race both cars got pretty decent efficiency as it was a cloudy day not too cold one challenge tesla driver ran into was that his cars range was greater than his bladders range (something most people evs know happens especially with kids) he had to stop at a rest area for a quick breakas they got into texas rain started cutting some range efficiency necessitating lower speeds for safety this would have put tesla range for a charger further away but they decided to not try that rain continued into texarkana on to new boston texas tesla driver went for nash supercharger while bolt driver went for a charger 20 miles furtherthe first stops werent bad at first one time waster came up right away nash texas when first charger wouldnt work for tesla (something people hate on electrify america for) it took a re-parking plugging back to get it going bolt driver stopped at a travel center where he found a mostly empty supercharger his worked on first try (via app) unfortunately after trying to charge for a few minutes tesla driver found that supercharger was going slow so he went on to new boston too hoping for a faster charge meeting up with bolt driverby time they left new boston teslas faster charging speed more than made up for bathroom break they were headed out for royse city to charge at buc-ees they both decided to use supercharger station there instead of giving chargepoint mercedes-benz a chance (something ive done that worked out pretty well) at this point tesla was pretty far into its charge putting him leaving about time that bolt was pulling but it wasnt long before tesla got stuck dallas trafficwhen tesla showed up at second charging stop abbott he chose to not stay very long because station was very full he didnt need very long to get to next one when bolt got to abbott station was actually full he didnt think he had enough of a charge to get anywhere else he figured out that he could get to an electrify america station instead of waiting (and watching two teslas cut him line) so he bailed went to walmart where he found that half of stalls were dead working ones were all use they figured that extra charger traffic could be due to electrify expothe teslas last stop temple texas was at a station with a mix of v3 v3/v4 charging stalls by this time he was a ways ahead of bolt only needed a 10 minute stop to avoid needing more stops bolt driver stayed at electrify america for long enough to get 93 miles to get to next chargerall all tesla took 105 hours with traffic weather causing extra 15 hours of time along way exactly an hour later bolt driver showed up to hotel that was after dealing with a 35-minute charging wait wacofinal thoughtsultimately trip time wasnt really all that different between two vehicles despite tesla having a huge theoretical advantage even with problems both vehicles experienced (including a supercharger with problems) a difference of only an hour really isnt big problem people say it online but getting performance out of bolt required some knowledge of ev charging use of two apps while tesla handled most of thinking for chargingwhen you consider that a bolt like one video can be had for as little as $15000 its hard to say that its a clear choice for many people used bolt all ev they can afford so it makes no sense to tell people that
